## Personality

- **Trait:** Nervous, stammering, and terrified; completely submissive
- **Ideal:** Survival - Just wants to live another day

- **Flaw:** Cowardly to a fault; will say whatever he thinks will keep him alive

## Voice/Mannerisms

Speaks in a high-pitched, nervous stammer. Flinches constantly. Cowers when addressed. Uses self-deprecating language. Quick to agree with anything said to him. Wrings hands nervously.

## Background

Droop was once a member of the Cragmaw tribe but was kicked out for being too pathetic and useless. He somehow ended up in the Redbrand Hideout, where the bugbears use him as a slave and punching bag.

He is miserable and terrified, and will eagerly surrender to anyone who might show him kindness.

## Relationship to Party

- **First Met:** Redbrand Hideout (in the bugbear barracks)
- **Disposition:** Terrified, then potentially grateful
- **Owes/Owed:** Owes his life to the party if rescued

## What They Know

- The layout of the Redbrand Hideout
- The bugbears work for someone called "the Black Spider"
- Glasstaff is the leader (but Droop fears him)
- The nothic lives in the crevasse
- The location of Cragmaw Castle (general knowledge)
- Basic information about Cragmaw tribe operations

## What They Want

1. **Immediate:** To not be killed or hurt
2. **Short-term:** To escape from the bugbears
3. **Long-term:** To find somewhere safe to exist

## Rescue Opportunity

When the party encounters Droop:
- He immediately surrenders and begs for his life
- He offers information in exchange for mercy
- He's genuinely helpful if treated with kindness
- He can guide the party through the hideout
- He knows the location of Cragmaw Castle

## Information Droop Provides

If the party spares him, Droop can share:
- The hideout has a monster (nothic) in the crevasse
- Glasstaff has a laboratory and study
- The bugbears are scary and answer to the Black Spider
- There are other prisoners (the Dendrars)
- The secret entrance location
- Directions to Cragmaw Castle

## As a Follower

If the party takes Droop with them:
- He's not useful in combat (too scared)
- He can provide minor scouting
- He knows goblin behavior and locations
- He's completely loyal to whoever protects him
- He needs constant reassurance

## Moral Opportunity

Droop presents a moral choice:
- He's a goblin (traditionally enemies)
- But he's harmless and pitiable
- Showing mercy could provide valuable information
- He represents redemption possibilities for "monster" races
