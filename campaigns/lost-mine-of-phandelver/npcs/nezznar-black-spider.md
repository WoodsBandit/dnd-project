## Personality

- **Trait:** Intelligent, curious, and patient; studies his enemies before acting
- **Ideal:** Knowledge - The Forge of Spells represents ultimate arcane power
- **Bond:** Ambition drives everything; has no true loyalty to anyone
- **Flaw:** Arrogance; believes himself superior to surface dwellers; will betray allies when convenient

## Voice/Mannerisms

Speaks with cold, precise diction. Takes his time, never rushing. Studies people intently before responding. Uses spider imagery in his speech patterns. Rarely raises his voice - quiet menace is more effective.

## Background

Nezznar is a drow wizard who somehow learned of the Rockseeker brothers' search for Wave Echo Cave. He employed an extensive network of spies - reaching as far as Neverwinter - to track their progress.

When the Rockseekers finally discovered the cave entrance, Nezznar's spies reported back. He moved quickly to seize the opportunity, establishing alliances with local forces to help him claim the Forge of Spells.

- The fate of Nundro Rockseeker hangs in the balance

## Notes

- Main antagonist of the adventure
- Appears late in the story (Chapter 4)
- Some DMs find his introduction abrupt and add more foreshadowing
- Consider having captured enemies mention "the Black Spider" more often
- His spider motif can be used throughout the adventure (spider symbols, web imagery)
