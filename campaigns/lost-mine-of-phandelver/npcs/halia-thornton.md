[FILL FROM BOOK: Specific physical description]

## Personality

- **Trait:** Ambitious and practical; always looking for an angle
- **Ideal:** Power - Wealth and influence are the true measures of success
- **Bond:** Loyalty to the Zhentarim and its goal of secret control
- **Flaw:** Underestimates others; sees people primarily as tools to be used

## Voice/Mannerisms

Speaks with businesslike efficiency. Direct and to the point. Occasional hints of menace beneath the professional exterior. Always steering conversations toward topics that benefit her.

## Background

Halia Thornton runs the Phandalin Miner's Exchange, a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. It serves as an informal gathering place and records office.

Secretly, Halia is an agent of the Zhentarim - a powerful organization that seeks to exert control over the North through wealth and influence. The Zhentarim have learned of the potential in Wave Echo Cave and want to position themselves to profit.

## Relationship to Party

- **First Met:** Phandalin Miner's Exchange
- **Disposition:** Neutral (opportunistic)
- **Owes/Owed:** Will pay for services rendered

## What They Know

- Everything about local mining and trade in the region
- The Redbrands' activities and their leader Glasstaff
- Business opportunities in Phandalin
- Zhentarim intelligence about regional developments
- The significance of Wave Echo Cave's rediscovery

## What They Want

1. **Immediate:** Have Glasstaff eliminated and his correspondence secured
2. **Short-term:** Take control of the Redbrand organization herself
3. **Long-term:** Position the Zhentarim to profit from Wave Echo Cave

## Quest Given

### Eliminate the Redbrand Leader
- **Objective:** Kill the leader of the Redbrands and bring any correspondence found in his quarters
- **True Motive:** Halia wants to take over the Redbrand operation herself
- **Reward:** 100 gp
- **Faction Opportunity:** May offer Zhentarim recruitment

**Important Note:** Halia wants Glasstaff's letters and documents - she's particularly interested in any correspondence with his contacts (including the Black Spider). The party may not realize they're helping the Zhentarim consolidate power.

## The Zhentarim

Halia can share (or hint at) information about the Zhentarim:
- A powerful merchant organization with interests throughout the North
- They seek profit and influence
- Membership offers access to resources and connections
- The Zhentarim are pragmatic - they're willing to work with anyone useful

**Zhentarim Recruitment:**
If the party completes her quest, she may offer membership (rank of Fang).

## The Phandalin Miner's Exchange

The Exchange serves as:
- A trading post for miners to sell their findings
- An unofficial records office
- A gathering place for business dealings
- Halia's base of operations

## Town Politics

Halia sits on the unofficial town council alongside:
- Sildar Hallwinter (Lords' Alliance) - She maintains a cordial professional relationship
- Harbin Wester (Townmaster) - She finds him weak and ineffective
- Trilena Stonehill (innkeeper's wife)

She seeks to expand her influence in town governance.

## Moral Complexity

Halia presents a moral choice for the party:
- She opposes the Redbrands (good, on the surface)
- But she wants to take them over, not eliminate them
- She represents Zhentarim interests, which are often at odds with true justice
- Accepting her offer means becoming entangled with a morally gray faction

## Stats (if needed)

[FILL FROM BOOK: Spy or noble statblock]

## Notes

- Represents the Zhentarim faction hook
- Creates moral ambiguity in the Redbrand quest
- Could become an ally or rival depending on party choices
- Good source of business-related information
- Her true motives may not be immediately apparent
