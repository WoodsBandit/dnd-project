[FILL FROM BOOK: Specific physical description]

## Personality

- **Trait:** Cowardly and self-serving; avoids conflict at all costs
- **Ideal:** Safety - Better to appease troublemakers than confront them
- **Bond:** His position and the comfort it provides
- **Flaw:** Fundamentally corrupt and ineffective; refuses to acknowledge problems

## Voice/Mannerisms

Speaks in a blustering, defensive manner. Makes excuses constantly. Avoids eye contact when challenged. Quick to redirect blame. Uses bureaucratic language to delay action. Becomes more nervous and stammering when pressed.

## Background

Harbin Wester holds the position of Townmaster in Phandalin, a title that grants him authority over local governance. However, he has proven completely ineffective at addressing the town's problems, particularly the Redbrand threat.

His cowardice and self-interest have led him to essentially ignore the Redbrands, claiming they're "just a mercenary guild" and "not all that much trouble."

## Relationship to Party

- **First Met:** Townmaster's Hall in Phandalin
- **Disposition:** Nervous; tries to downplay problems
- **Owes/Owed:** Will reluctantly pay for completing official bounties

## What They Know

- The official (sanitized) state of affairs in Phandalin
- Orc raiders have been spotted near Wyvern Tor
- Administrative matters regarding the town
- Very little useful information (due to willful ignorance)

## What They Want

1. **Immediate:** For problems to go away without him having to do anything
2. **Short-term:** Maintain his comfortable position
3. **Long-term:** Avoid responsibility and conflict

## Quest Given

### Orc Trouble at Wyvern Tor
- **Objective:** Deal with the orc raiders near Wyvern Tor
- **Posted:** As a bounty on the Townmaster's Hall notice board
- **Reward:** 100 gp
- **Note:** This is the only quest Harbin actively offers; he refuses to address the Redbrand situation

## Attitudes

### On the Redbrands
- Claims they're "just a mercenary guild"
- Says they're "not all that much trouble"
- Refuses to take action against them
- Becomes defensive if challenged on this

### On His Responsibilities
- Makes excuses for inaction
- Redirects problems to others
- Hides behind bureaucratic procedures
- Prioritizes his own safety over the town's welfare

## The Townmaster's Hall

The hall serves as:
- The center of local government
- A meeting place for town business
- Location of the notice board with bounties
- Harbin's office and base of operations

After the Redbrands are dealt with, Sildar Hallwinter will also establish himself here.

## Political Position

Harbin is increasingly marginalized:
- Sildar Hallwinter has little respect for him
- Halia Thornton sees him as weak
- Townspeople have lost faith in his leadership
- He may be replaced after the adventure concludes

## Contrast with Sildar

Harbin and Sildar represent opposite approaches to governance:
- Harbin: Cowardly, corrupt, self-interested
- Sildar: Principled, brave, community-minded

This contrast can be highlighted once Sildar arrives in town.

## Stats (if needed)
