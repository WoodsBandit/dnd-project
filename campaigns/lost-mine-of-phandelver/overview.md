## Adventure Background

### The Phandelver's Pact (Historical)

More than five hundred years ago, in the 10th century DR, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as **Phandelver's Pact**. They agreed to share the mineral wealth found in Wave Echo Cave - a cavern rich in mithril, platinum, and magical properties.

When it was discovered that the cavern possessed wondrous magical properties, human spellcasters from the nearby town of Phandalin allied with the dwarves and gnomes. Together, they bound this magic into a forge called the **Forge of Spells**, where they could craft powerful magical weapons and items.

### The Fall of Wave Echo Cave (951 DR)

The prosperity was not to last. In 951 DR, orcs of **Uruth Ukrypt** swept down from the north, aided by mercenary wizards, and attacked Wave Echo Cave. The human spellcasters of Phandalin fought alongside the dwarves and gnomes, but the resulting magical battle devastated the cavern. Few survived, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost to history.

Phandalin itself was destroyed during the **Orcfastings War**, and lay abandoned for centuries.

### Recent Events (1491 DR)

- Phandalin has been resettled over the past few years as prospectors and settlers seek their fortunes
- The **Rockseeker brothers** (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) have rediscovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave
- Gundren Rockseeker hired adventurers to escort supplies to Phandalin while he rode ahead with his map
- Unknown to the Rockseekers, they were being watched by spies of a drow named **Nezznar**, the Black Spider
- Gundren and his companion Sildar Hallwinter were ambushed by the Cragmaw goblins and captured
- The criminal gang known as the **Redbrands** has been terrorizing Phandalin
- All signs point to a shadowy figure called "the Black Spider" pulling the strings
