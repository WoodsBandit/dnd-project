# Campaigns

Each campaign gets its own folder with the following structure:

```
[campaign-name]/
├── overview.md         # Campaign setting, themes, major arcs
├── npcs/               # NPC profiles
├── locations/          # Location descriptions and maps
├── sessions/           # Session notes (session-01.md, etc.)
├── players/            # PC sheets and backstories
└── assets/             # Maps, handouts, reference images
```

## Creating a New Campaign

1. Create folder: `campaigns/[campaign-name]/`
2. Add `overview.md` with setting and goals
3. Create subfolders as needed
4. Link in main `index.md`
