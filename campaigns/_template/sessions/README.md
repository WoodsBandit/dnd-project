## How to Organize Session Notes

### File Structure
```
sessions/
├── README.md              # This file - session organization guide
├── _template.md           # Copy this for new sessions
├── session-00-setup.md    # Session 0 notes
├── session-01-title.md    # Session 1
├── session-02-title.md    # Session 2
└── ...
```

### Naming Convention
Use this format: `session-XX-brief-title.md`

Examples:
- `session-00-setup.md` - Session 0 (character creation, expectations)
- `session-01-the-gathering.md`
- `session-02-into-the-ruins.md`
- `session-12-confronting-the-king.md`

**Rules:**
- Always use two digits for the session number (01, 02, ... 10, 11)
- Keep titles brief (2-4 words)
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- No special characters

### When to Write Notes
- **During Session:** Jot down key points, names, numbers
- **After Session:** Expand notes while memory is fresh (within 24 hours ideal)
- **Before Next Session:** Review to prep and catch loose threads

## Tips for Session Notes

### During the Session
1. **Keep a Scratch Pad:** Jot names, numbers, and key moments
2. **Note Exact Wording:** Player promises, NPC dialogue, prophecies
3. **Mark Time:** Note when days pass or time-sensitive things occur
4. **Flag Questions:** Write down rules to look up later

### After the Session
1. **Write the Recap First:** This is what you'll read next time
2. **Be Concise:** Bullet points over paragraphs
3. **Link Liberally:** Connect to NPC and location files
4. **Note the Unsaid:** What you planned that didn't happen (save for later)

### Player Involvement
- Consider having a player be the designated note-taker
- Rotate the responsibility each session
- Review notes together at session start for corrections
- Award inspiration for detailed player notes

### Long-Term Benefits
- Consistent notes make campaign recaps easy
- You'll catch dropped plot threads
- Players feel their choices matter when you remember details
- Great for writing campaign summaries or sharing stories
