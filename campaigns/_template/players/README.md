## How to Organize Player Content

### File Structure
```
players/
├── README.md           # This file - party overview and tracking
├── _template.md        # Copy this for each player character
├── [character-name].md # Individual character files
└── retired/            # (Optional) Folder for retired/dead characters
```

### Naming Convention
Use the character name in lowercase with hyphens:
- `korrath-ironforge.md`
- `lyra-shadowmend.md`
- `the-masked-wanderer.md`

### What Goes in Player Files vs. DM Notes
**In Player Files (this folder):**
- Information the player has shared
- Backstory as the player wrote it
- Character goals (player-stated)
- Development during the campaign

**In DM Notes (separate or in your prep):**
- Secret backstory elements
- Planned surprises
- NPC connections the player doesn't know about
- Planned character arc beats
