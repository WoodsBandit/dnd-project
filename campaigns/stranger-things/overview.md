## DM Notes

The adventure features:
- Multiple solution paths - failure is rarely an end-game
- Opportunities for roleplay with monsters (troglodyte negotiation)
- Balance of combat, exploration, and roleplay encounters
- Traps and hidden doors throughout
- Morale and faction mechanics for monsters
- Potential for players to be seen as heroes or demigods by certain creatures

**Key DM Guidance:**
- Fire damage is essential against the Thessalhydra - remind players if needed
- The adventure features multiple solution paths - combat isn't always required
- Pacing suggestion: 2-4 sessions total (Chapter 3 is the longest)
- Winter's Dark Bite should go to the Paladin for maximum impact
- The Demogorgon can be wounded and escaped, not necessarily killed
- Troglodyte diplomacy should feel rewarding, not like skipping content
