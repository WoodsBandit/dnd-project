## The Riddles

The Lost Knight presents two riddles. Both must be solved to reveal the passage.

---

### Riddle 1: The Chase Paradox

When the party first encounters the Lost Knight, he flees down a corridor, calling out:

> "Catch me if you can! But know this: **The front is the back. Hello is goodbye.**"

**The Puzzle:**
If the party chases the Lost Knight, every time they round a corner, they see him escaping at the far end of the hall. No matter how fast they run, they never catch up.

**The Solution:**
The party must **stop chasing** the Lost Knight. They should turn around and go **back the way they came**. When they do, the Lost Knight appears before them, pleased.

**Hints for Struggling Players:**
- "You seem to be getting nowhere. Perhaps the direct approach is wrong?"
- "Remember my words: the front is the back."
- A clever player might realize they're going in circles

### Riddle 2: The Blackbird Statues

After solving the first riddle, the Lost Knight leads the party to a chamber with shelves holding statues of blackbirds. This riddle references the nursery rhyme "Sing a Song of Sixpence."

> "Four-and-twenty blackbirds, baked in a pie. One has left its shelf. Place the correct one, or face the sky's wrath."

**The Setup:**
- There are 24 statue positions on shelves
- One empty space where a statue should go
- Several candidate statues to choose from

**The Solution:**
The players must identify which blackbird belongs in the empty space based on the nursery rhyme. The correct statue is the one that completes the pattern.

**Consequence for Wrong Answer:**
Everyone in the room takes lightning damage (representing "the sky's wrath").

**Hints:**
- Reference to "Sing a Song of Sixpence" is the key clue
- The statues may have subtle differences to identify
- Players familiar with the nursery rhyme have an advantage

## Consequences

### If Riddles Are Solved Correctly

The Lost Knight congratulates the party:

> "You have proven yourselves worthy. The passage to the Upside Down awaits."

The knight gestures, and a portal or passage opens, leading to Chapter 5.

**The Warning:**
> "Know this - the way through is one direction only. You must find another path home."

### If Riddles Are Answered Incorrectly

**Riddle 1 Failure:** The party continues chasing endlessly until they realize their mistake or take a short rest to think.

**Riddle 2 Failure:** Lightning damage to all in the room (suggest 2d6 or 3d6 lightning damage, DC 13 DEX save for half). They can try again with a different statue.

The Lost Knight does not become hostile - merely waits for the correct answer.

## Combat Stats

The Lost Knight is **immune to damage and cannot be hit except with a critical hit** (and even then, likely only disrupts their form briefly). Combat is not the solution here.

If attacked repeatedly, the Lost Knight simply fades away and reappears elsewhere in the labyrinth, forcing the party to find them again.

## Roleplay Tips

- Remain calm and patient, even if players become frustrated
- The knight is not malicious - they are bound to this duty
- Allow creative solutions that demonstrate understanding of the riddle's theme
- If players are completely stuck, have the knight repeat the key phrases

## Notes

The Lost Knight represents a classic D&D trope - the guardian who tests adventurers with puzzles rather than combat. This encounter provides a change of pace from the combat-heavy dungeon sections and challenges players to think differently.

**DM Tip:** If the riddle section is dragging, provide more direct hints. The goal is engagement, not frustration.
