## Notes for DMs

Eleven represents what happens when D&D fantasy becomes reality - a character with actual supernatural abilities fighting actual monsters. Her arc shows the hero's journey outside the game.

When running this adventure, consider:

- How El's story parallels the in-game heroes' journey
- The theme of friendship being the true power
