### Special Abilities

**Multiple Serpent Heads.** The thessalhydra has eight serpent heads. While it has more than one head, it has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.

Whenever the thessalhydra takes 10 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the thessalhydra dies.

At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each one that died since its last turn, unless it took fire damage since its last turn. The thessalhydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.

**Reactive Heads.** For each head the thessalhydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.

**Hold Breath.** The thessalhydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The thessalhydra makes one maw attack and one Flurry of Bites attack.

**Maw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) acid damage.

**Flurry of Bites.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (4d4) poison damage.

**Tail Pincer.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d12 + 4) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the thessalhydra can't use its tail pincer on another target.

**Acid Saliva (Recharge 5–6).** The thessalhydra spits a glob of acid at a point within 30 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Legendary Actions

The thessalhydra can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The thessalhydra regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The thessalhydra makes a Wisdom (Perception) check with advantage.

**Tail Swipe.** The thessalhydra makes one tail pincer attack.

## Combat Tactics

The Thessalhydra fights with savage intelligence:
1. **Opening:** Uses Acid Saliva on grouped enemies
2. **Focus fire:** Targets wounded enemies with Flurry of Bites
3. **Grapple:** Uses Tail Pincer to immobilize threats (spellcasters, healers)
4. **Regeneration:** Takes advantage of multiple heads to outlast the party
5. **Legendary Actions:** Uses Tail Swipe to grapple fleeing enemies or Detect to find hiding targets

### Weaknesses

- **Fire Damage:** Prevents head regeneration - essential for defeating it
- **Concentrated damage:** 10+ damage in one turn kills a head
- **Single target:** Can only grapple one creature at a time

### DM Tips

- Describe each head independently - give them subtle personality
- Emphasize the acid dripping from the central maw
- Use terrain in the lair (pools of acid, narrow passages)
- Track heads carefully - this is the key mechanic
- If party lacks fire, consider providing environmental fire sources

## Lair Features

The Thessalhydra's lair may include:
- Pools of corrosive acid
- Bones of previous victims
- Narrow tunnels the creature uses to ambush
- A central chamber where it makes its stand
- Troglodyte worshippers in adjacent areas

## Loot

After defeating the Thessalhydra, the party can:
- Sever the heads to bring back to Sir Tristan (100 gp per head)
- Search the lair for hoarded treasure
- Collect acid samples (valuable alchemical component)

## Stranger Things Connection

The Thessalhydra is directly referenced in Stranger Things Season 1's finale. In the show, Mike's campaign ends with the party debating whether Will's final roll defeated the Thessalhydra or not, leaving the campaign on a cliffhanger before real-world events intervene. This adventure brings that campaign to life.

## Notes

As the final boss, the Thessalhydra encounter should be climactic and memorable:
- Use environmental hazards in the lair
- Emphasize dramatic pacing
- Consider multiple phases based on head count
- Victory requires severing the heads for proof
- The party should feel heroic upon victory
