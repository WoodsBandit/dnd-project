# Troglodytes

**Race/Ancestry:** Troglodyte (Reptilian humanoids)
**Occupation:** Cave dwellers, tribal warriors
**Location:** Troglodyte Caverns (11 areas)
**Faction:** Troglodyte Tribes
**Status:** Active (Can be allied with or fought)

## Appearance

Reptilian humanoids with grayish, scaly skin standing about 5 feet tall. They have long, clawed hands, a spiny frill running down their backs, and emit a powerful stench as a defensive mechanism. Their eyes are adapted for darkness, reflecting light like a cat's.

## Personality (General)

- **Trait:** Territorial, suspicious of outsiders
- **Ideal:** Survival of the tribe above all
- **Bond:** Their cavern home and tribal hierarchy
- **Flaw:** Initial hostility can be overcome with clever roleplay

## Voice/Mannerisms

Hissing, guttural speech. Suspicious body language - constantly tasting the air with forked tongues. They communicate through a mix of crude Common (if the King is present) and their own language of hisses and clicks.

## Relationship to Party

- **First Met:** Troglodyte Caverns (Chapter 3)
- **Disposition:** Hostile initially - CAN BE NEGOTIATED WITH
- **Owes/Owed:** May owe allegiance if party earns their respect

## Key NPC: The Troglodyte King

The Troglodyte King is the leader of the main tribe in the caverns and uniquely **speaks Common**. This makes him the key to any diplomatic solution.

**Name:** Sketh-Kra (or similar hissing name)
**Role:** Tribal leader, information source
**Disposition:** Wary but pragmatic

### What the King Knows
- The location of the Cursed Labyrinth (exit from the caverns)
- The dangers beyond their territory
- That something worse than troglodytes lives deeper in
- The path the party needs to take

### What the King Wants
- Protection for his tribe
- The party to leave without killing more of his warriors
- Possibly: help dealing with other threats (giant spiders, ochre jelly)

## Faction Dynamics

**Important:** The adventure emphasizes that morale and faction alliances can turn combat encounters into roleplay or chase sequences. The troglodytes are the largest faction that can potentially view the adventurers as heroes or demigods.

### Negotiation Opportunities

**Trigger Negotiation:**
- Defeat several troglodytes without killing all of them
- Call out for parley in Common
- Show mercy to a wounded troglodyte
- Display impressive magic or feats

**The King's Offer:**
If the party seeks negotiation, the Troglodyte King approaches:
- Safe passage through the caverns
- Information about what lies ahead
- In exchange: leave his people alone, possibly deal with the giant spiders/ochre jelly threatening them

### Becoming Heroes/Demigods

If the party performs impressive feats or helps the tribe:
- Kill the giant spiders that plague the troglodytes
- Destroy the ochre jelly
- Heal wounded troglodytes
- Demonstrate powerful magic

**Consequence:** The troglodytes may view the party as divine beings or legendary heroes. This grants:
- Complete safe passage
- Troglodyte escorts/guides
- Gifts of what little treasure they have
- Information freely given
- Potential allies for the return journey

### Consequences of Alliance

**Benefits:**
- Skip most combat encounters in the caverns
- Gain valuable information
- Safe path to the Cursed Labyrinth
- Possible help if the party returns this way

**Potential Trouble:**
- Other troglodyte factions may not honor the King's agreement
- The party may owe the tribe a favor
- Some troglodytes may test the party's resolve

## Cavern Encounter Groups

| Area | Troglodytes | Special |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Entry | 2-3 scouts | Alert others if not stopped |
| Guard Post | 4-5 warriors | Will parley if losing |
| Living Area | 6-8 mixed | Non-combatants present |
| King's Chamber | King + 4 guards | Primary negotiation point |

## Combat Tactics

1. **Initial Response:** Scouts attempt to alert the tribe
2. **Stench:** Use their stench to sicken intruders
3. **Ambush:** Use Chameleon Skin to hide and ambush
4. **Morale:** Check morale when half are killed - may flee or surrender
5. **The King's Call:** If losing badly, the King may call for parley

## Morale Rules

When half the troglodytes in an encounter are killed:
- Roll a DC 12 Wisdom save for the leader
- On failure: The group flees or attempts to parley
- If the King is present: He always attempts parley before fleeing

## Notes

The troglodytes represent one of the adventure's best opportunities for creative problem-solving. Encourage players to consider diplomacy alongside combat.

**DM Tips:**
- Have early troglodytes flee to show they're not mindless
- Let the King approach after a few encounters
- Reward clever solutions with easier passage
- The "demigod" status is meant to be fun and memorable
- Don't punish players who choose combat - it's still viable
