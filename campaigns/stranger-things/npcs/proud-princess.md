# The Proud Princess

**Race/Ancestry:** Spectral/Undead (Bound Spirit)
**Occupation:** Watcher of the Upside Down
**Location:** The Upside Down (optional encounter)
**Faction:** Neutral
**Status:** Bound to the Upside Down (cannot leave)

## Appearance

A spectral woman in tattered noble garb, seated upon what was once a throne. Her form is translucent, shimmering with the same sickly blue-gray light that permeates the Upside Down. Her clothing suggests she was royalty in life - a princess of some forgotten realm. Her eyes hold ancient knowledge and a profound sadness.

> "In a small chamber off the main passage, you find a strange sight: a spectral woman in tattered noble garb, sitting on what was once a throne. She looks up as you enter, her eyes holding ancient knowledge. 'More seekers,' she says. 'How curious.'"

## Personality

- **Trait:** Melancholic, knowing, detached from mortal concerns
- **Ideal:** Wisdom - sharing knowledge with those who seek it, for she cannot act herself
- **Bond:** Bound to the Upside Down for reasons she no longer remembers (or will not say)
- **Flaw:** Speaks only in riddles and metaphors; cannot give direct answers

## Voice/Mannerisms

Speak with melancholy and distant wisdom. She has watched countless travelers come and go over ages untold. Her voice is soft, echoing slightly as if coming from far away. She shows neither urgency nor alarm - she is beyond such mortal emotions.

**Suggested Voice:** Soft, ethereal, with long pauses. Speaks as if reciting poetry or prophecy.

**Key Phrases:**
- "More seekers... how curious."
- "I was a princess once. Now I am... advice."
- "The shadow-walker hunts. Do not bleed where it can find you."
- "Fire is the beast's bane - without flame, it cannot die."

## Relationship to Party

- **First Met:** The Upside Down (optional encounter during exploration)
- **Disposition:** Neutral - neither helps nor hinders, simply observes and shares
- **Owes/Owed:** Nothing - she shares freely with any who find her

## What She Knows

The Proud Princess shares cryptic but valuable information:

### About the Thessalhydra
> "The beast you seek has eight minds but one hunger. Fire is its bane - without flame, it cannot die."

- The Thessalhydra has 8 heads (eight minds)
- Fire damage prevents its regeneration
- Without fire, defeating it is nearly impossible

### About the Demogorgon
> "The shadow-walker hunts in this place. It smells blood. Do not bleed where it can find you."

- The Demogorgon has Keen Smell (advantage on smell-based Perception)
- It has Blood Frenzy (advantage vs. wounded creatures)
- Avoiding injury reduces the danger

### About the Path Forward
> "The way out lies beyond the hunter's domain. You must pass through, not around."

- The exit to the Thessalhydra's lair lies past the Demogorgon
- There is no way to circumvent the encounter entirely
- They must face or evade the Demogorgon to proceed

### About Winter's Dark Bite
> "The blade of dark metal... it was made for this place. Here, it is strongest."

- Winter's Dark Bite has enhanced power in the Upside Down (+4 bonus)
- The blade's material originates from this dimension
- It is particularly effective against creatures of this realm

## What She Wants

Nothing. The Proud Princess is beyond wanting. She exists, she watches, she shares what she knows with those who find her. If she has any desire, it is simply to see travelers succeed where others have failed - but even this is a distant, detached hope.

## Mysteries She Will Not Answer

- Who she was in life
- Why she is bound to the Upside Down
- How long she has been here
- Whether she can be freed
- The true nature of the Upside Down

If pressed on these matters:
> "Some questions have no answers. Some answers would serve no purpose. I am what I am, and I know what I know. That must suffice."

## Combat Stats

The Proud Princess is **immune to damage and cannot be hit except with a critical hit** (and even then, the attack simply passes through her form with no effect). Combat is meaningless here - she cannot be harmed, and she will not fight.

If attacked:
> "You waste your strength on shadows. I am not your enemy - nor could I be, even if I wished it."

She does not flee or become hostile. She simply waits for the party to realize that violence accomplishes nothing.

## Roleplay Tips

- Maintain an air of ancient sadness - she has seen much and forgotten more
- Never rush - she has all of eternity
- Speak in metaphors: "eight minds" not "eight heads," "shadow-walker" not "Demogorgon"
- If players ask for clarification, repeat the same information in different metaphorical terms
- She should feel like encountering a ghost from a fairy tale - otherworldly but not threatening

## Connection to the Lost Knight

The Proud Princess and the Lost Knight are similar beings - bound spirits who test or aid adventurers. Where the Lost Knight challenges with riddles, the Princess provides counsel. Both are immune to damage. Both cannot leave their respective domains.

Whether they share a common origin, curse, or purpose is left deliberately mysterious.

## Notes

The Proud Princess is an **optional encounter** in Chapter 5. Players may miss her entirely if they don't explore. However, her information is valuable:

| Information | Game Impact |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fire stops regeneration | Essential for Thessalhydra fight |
| Demogorgon tracks blood | Tactical awareness |
| Must pass the Demogorgon | Confirms no bypass exists |
| Winter's Dark Bite is strongest here | Encourages Paladin to engage |

**DM Tip:** If the party is struggling in the Upside Down or hasn't figured out the fire weakness, ensure they find the Proud Princess. Her hints can prevent a TPK in Chapter 6.

## The Stranger Things Connection

The Proud Princess represents an original addition to the D&D Stranger Things adventure, evoking the trapped spirits and mysterious NPCs common to classic fairy tales and gothic horror. She fits the unsettling atmosphere of the Upside Down while providing a moment of eerie calm before the Demogorgon encounter.
