# The Demogorgon

**Race/Ancestry:** Monstrosity (Upside Down creature)
**Occupation:** Apex Predator of the Upside Down
**Location:** The Upside Down
**Faction:** Creatures of the Upside Down
**Status:** Alive (Major Antagonist)

## Appearance

A terrifying creature from the Upside Down dimension. This is *not* the demon prince Demogorgon from D&D lore, but rather a monstrous predator native to the Upside Down - the creature that inspired the name the kids gave to the monster in the Stranger Things show.

The demogorgon is a humanoid horror with elongated limbs, pale grayish skin, and a head that opens like a flower to reveal rows of razor-sharp teeth.

## Personality

- **Trait:** Relentless, predatory, drawn to blood
- **Ideal:** Hunt, consume, survive
- **Bond:** The Upside Down is its home territory
- **Flaw:** Enters a blood frenzy that can make it predictable

## Voice/Mannerisms

The demogorgon does not speak. It shrieks, clicks, and makes otherworldly sounds. Describe its movements as unnaturally fluid, its "face" opening in a horrific display when it attacks.

## Relationship to Party

- **First Met:** In the Upside Down (Chapter 5)
- **Disposition:** Hostile
- **Owes/Owed:** N/A - This is a monster encounter

## What They Know

- The layout of the Upside Down
- The location of the exit to the Thessalhydra's lair
- Nothing it can communicate

## What They Want

- Hunt prey (the party)
- Protect its territory
- Feed

### Special Abilities

**Keen Smell.** The demogorgon has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

**Blood Frenzy.** The demogorgon has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all of its hit points.

**Regeneration.** The demogorgon regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the demogorgon takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the demogorgon's next turn. The demogorgon dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The demogorgon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.

## Combat Tactics

The demogorgon is a savage but effective predator:

1. **Stalking:** Uses Stealth to approach the party before striking
2. **Blood Frenzy:** Focuses attacks on wounded characters to gain advantage
3. **Regeneration:** Will fight recklessly knowing it can heal
4. **Relentless:** Won't retreat unless severely damaged with fire/acid

### Weaknesses

- **Fire/Acid Damage:** Shuts down regeneration for a turn
- **Light:** The Upside Down is dark; bright light may disorient it
- **Blood Frenzy:** Makes it predictable - it targets wounded allies

### DM Tips

- Emphasize the horror atmosphere of the Upside Down
- Have the demogorgon stalk the party before attacking
- Describe the face-opening attack in disturbing detail
- The regeneration can make this fight long - remind players of fire/acid
- **Players can wound it and escape** - they don't have to kill it to proceed

## Encounter Notes

**Important:** The adventure specifically notes that players don't need to fully defeat the demogorgon. Wounding it enough to escape is a valid strategy:

> "Once they defeat it (or even just wound it a bit) they can exit the Upside Down and enter the lair of the Thessalhydra."

This is important because:
- The regeneration can make the fight drag on
- Preserving resources for the Thessalhydra is wise
- It creates tension without requiring a TPK-risk fight

### Victory Conditions

- **Full Victory:** Reduce to 0 HP while it can't regenerate (fire/acid damage in previous turn)
- **Partial Victory:** Reduce below half HP to create an opening to escape
- **Escape:** Party successfully flees while demogorgon is occupied/wounded

## The Upside Down Environment

When fighting the demogorgon, the Upside Down itself is hostile:
- Dim light / darkness everywhere
- Organic, fleshy terrain
- Floating particles in the air
- Sounds seem muffled or distorted
- The environment feels oppressive and wrong

## Loot

The demogorgon has no treasure, but defeating or escaping it reveals:
- The path to the Thessalhydra's lair
- Possibly remains of previous victims with equipment

## Stranger Things Connection

In the Netflix series, the kids named the monster from the Upside Down "Demogorgon" after the D&D demon prince. This adventure uses a stat block inspired by the show's creature rather than the CR 26 demon prince from official D&D.

The Starter Set includes:
- A Demogorgon miniature figure (painted)
- A paintable Demogorgon figure for customization

## Notes

The demogorgon serves as a penultimate boss before the Thessalhydra:
- It tests the party's resources before the final fight
- Creates iconic Stranger Things atmosphere
- Introduces the horror of the Upside Down
- Provides a memorable set-piece encounter
