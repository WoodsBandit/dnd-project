- The creature's lair lies beyond dangerous territory
- The path leads through the troglodyte caverns
- The realm's best hope lies with brave adventurers
- He is willing to provide equipment and gold for success

## What They Want

Sir Tristan wants the adventurers to:
1. Hunt down the Thessalhydra
2. Destroy the creature
3. Return with the creature's heads as proof

## Reward Offered

### Gold Payment
> "I am willing to pay you each **100 Gold Pieces** for each head you bring back."

The Thessalhydra has 8 heads, making the potential reward:
- **100 gp per head** (800 gp total if all heads brought back)
- Split among the party

### Equipment Provided

Sir Tristan provides the party with equipment before they depart:

| Item | Recipient | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Rings of Protection | All party members | +1 AC while worn |
| Potions of Healing | All party members | 2d4+2 healing |
| Greatsword (magical) | Martial character | "Made for killing the Thessalhydra" |

| Bags of Holding | Party (2 total) | For carrying loot and heads |

### Additional Benefits
- All expenses covered during the quest
- Glory and honor as heroes of the realm
- Potential future patronage

## The Quest Briefing

When the party arrives, Sir Tristan delivers the quest:

> "I, Sir Tristan of the Crabapple Valley, am offering 100 gold pieces—plus all expenses and additional equipment—to each brave adventurer who would dare to face a terrible monster known as a Thessalhydra, that terrorizes the valley."

Key points to convey:
1. The Thessalhydra is the target
2. It threatens the entire realm
3. The reward is substantial
4. Equipment will be provided
5. The path is dangerous but heroes are needed

## Stats (if needed)

Use **Noble** statblock (MM p. 348) if combat becomes necessary (unlikely).

Sir Tristan is not a combatant - he is a quest giver and patron.

## Roleplay Tips

- Be grateful but businesslike
- Emphasize the danger without discouraging the party
- Present the equipment as a sign of good faith
- Show confidence in the party's abilities
- React with appropriate gravitas to the threat

## Return Scene

When the party returns victorious:
- Count the heads brought back
- Pay 100 gp per head
- Celebrate the heroes
- Mount the heads in the great hall
- Offer future patronage/friendship

If the party fails or retreats:
- Express disappointment but understanding
- Offer another chance or reduced reward
- Remain a sympathetic NPC

## Notes

Sir Tristan serves as the adventure hook, appearing at the beginning to set the quest in motion and at the end to reward success. His role is primarily narrative rather than participatory.

The adventure book is presented as Mike Wheeler's personal campaign journal, and Sir Tristan represents the classic "quest-giving noble" that Mike would have encountered in modules like the Red Box.
