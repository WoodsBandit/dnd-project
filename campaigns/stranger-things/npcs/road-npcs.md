# Road NPCs - Rumors on the Road

**Location:** The road between Sir Tristan's court and the Troglodyte Caverns
**Purpose:** Information gathering and roleplay encounters

## Overview

The "Rumors on the Road" section features four different NPCs that the party can encounter for roleplaying and information gathering. These encounters help set the tone and provide useful (or misleading) information about the quest ahead.

Based on public information, the road NPCs include travelers, priests, and farmers - common folk who have heard rumors or had encounters related to the Thessalhydra threat.

## NPC 1: Brother Aldric (Traveling Priest)

**Race/Ancestry:** Human
**Occupation:** Wandering priest/cleric
**Status:** Alive

### Appearance
A middle-aged man in simple brown robes, carrying a wooden holy symbol and a walking staff. His face is weathered from travel, and he speaks with quiet authority. He travels with a small cart containing religious texts and simple supplies.

### Personality
- **Trait:** Pious and concerned for the common folk
- **Ideal:** Faith provides strength against darkness

### Voice/Mannerisms
Speaks slowly and deliberately. Often invokes blessings or references to the divine. Pauses to consider his words carefully.

### Information They Share
- **True Rumor:** "The creature that plagues the valley is no ordinary beast. It is said to have many heads, each capable of independent thought and attack. Fire may be your greatest ally."
- **True Rumor:** "Travelers have spoken of foul-smelling creatures in the caverns to the north. Reptilian things that dwell in darkness."
- **Partial Truth:** "Some say the beast came from another realm entirely - a place of shadow and corruption."

### Roleplay Tips
Brother Aldric will offer to bless the party before they continue. He's genuinely concerned about their safety and offers what little healing supplies he has (a potion of healing if the party seems underequipped).

## NPC 2: Old Marta (Farmer)

**Race/Ancestry:** Human
**Occupation:** Farmer, recently displaced
**Status:** Alive (Traumatized)

### Appearance
An elderly woman with calloused hands and a haunted expression. Her clothes are travel-worn and dirty. She carries a small bundle of possessions - all she could grab when she fled her farm.

### Personality
- **Trait:** Frightened but grateful to talk to armed travelers
- **Ideal:** Survival and return to normalcy

### Voice/Mannerisms
Speaks quickly, nervously. Wrings her hands constantly. Eyes dart around as if expecting attack. Grateful for any kindness shown.

### Information They Share
- **True Rumor:** "I saw it. From a distance, thank the gods. A great serpentine thing with too many heads, slithering toward the mountains. My livestock... all dead. Melted by some foul liquid it spat."
- **True Rumor:** "The caves up north - don't go in unprepared. There's things living in there. I heard hissing and saw eyes reflecting in the dark when I passed nearby."
- **Warning:** "If you're hunting that thing, go well-armed. Sir Tristan sent soldiers before. They didn't come back."

### Roleplay Tips
Marta has lost everything to the Thessalhydra's attacks. She's heading to stay with relatives in a distant town. If the party shows compassion, she gives them her late husband's lucky copper piece (no mechanical benefit, but a touching moment).

## NPC 3: Garrett the Merchant

**Race/Ancestry:** Human
**Occupation:** Traveling merchant
**Status:** Alive

### Appearance
A portly man with a ready smile and shrewd eyes. He drives a colorful wagon filled with various goods. His clothes are of better quality than most travelers, and he wears several rings.

### Personality
- **Trait:** Opportunistic but not unkind
- **Ideal:** Profit, but not at the cost of human life

### Voice/Mannerisms
Speaks with a salesman's charm. Always looking for an opportunity to make a sale. Quick with jokes and stories. Knows when to be serious.

### Information They Share
- **True Rumor:** "The road ahead gets dangerous. Past the old mill, the trees grow thick and the caves begin. Something's driven the wildlife mad - I've seen deer running in packs, fleeing something."
- **Mixed Information:** "I've heard tell of a back entrance to those caves. Hunters used to use it. Might let you avoid some trouble... or might just get you lost." (Partially true - there are multiple paths, but he doesn't know the details)
- **Gossip:** "Sir Tristan's been sending adventurers after that beast for weeks now. You're not the first. Hopefully you'll be the last, eh?"

### Roleplay Tips
Garrett offers to sell the party supplies at fair prices (torches, rope, rations). He's genuinely helpful despite his merchant nature. If asked about the caves specifically, he admits he's never been inside - "That's not my kind of adventure, friends."

## NPC 4: Elira the Woodcutter's Daughter

**Race/Ancestry:** Human
**Occupation:** Woodcutter's assistant/hunter
**Status:** Alive

### Appearance
A young woman in her early twenties with short-cropped hair and practical hunting leathers. She carries a bow and a handaxe. Alert and capable, she moves with the confidence of someone comfortable in the wilderness.

### Personality
- **Trait:** Direct and practical
- **Ideal:** Knowledge of the land is power

### Voice/Mannerisms
Speaks plainly without flowery language. Makes direct eye contact. Wastes no words. Respects competence over titles.

### Information They Share
- **True Rumor:** "The lizard-folk in those caves - I've tracked them before. They're territorial but not stupid. Show them you're not easy prey and they might leave you alone. Show weakness and they'll swarm you."
- **True Rumor:** "There's something else in those caves besides the lizards. Bigger. I've seen webs the size of fishing nets, and once I found a trail of something that dissolved the very stone it touched."
- **Tactical Advice:** "If you're going through the caves, bring fire. Lots of it. The lizard-folk hate it, and whatever made those webs will burn."

### Roleplay Tips
Elira respects adventurers who seem competent. If the party has a Ranger, she'll engage them specifically with respect. She offers to guide them to the cave entrance for a small fee (5 gp) or for free if they seem likely to deal with the monster threat permanently.

## DM Notes

### Running These Encounters

**Order:** Present the NPCs in any order, or let players choose who to approach. Not all four need to be encountered.

**Pacing:** Keep each encounter to 5-10 minutes. These are meant to build atmosphere and provide information, not become lengthy scenes.

**Information Control:** The most important information is:
1. The Thessalhydra has multiple heads
2. Fire is useful
3. There are dangerous creatures in the caves
4. Diplomacy with troglodytes is possible

### Adjustments

- If the party is rushing, have one NPC approach them
- If they're thorough, reward investigation with bonus details
- If they're rude to NPCs, that NPC's information may be withheld
- Combat with NPCs should be avoided - they flee if threatened

### Transition

After NPC encounters, describe the approach to the caverns:

> "The road narrows as the trees grow thicker. The cheerful warmth of the travelers fades behind you. Ahead, the forest darkens, and you spot the black mouth of a cave yawning in the hillside. The air carries a faint, unpleasant smell - like rotting meat and sulfur. You have arrived at the Troglodyte Caverns."
