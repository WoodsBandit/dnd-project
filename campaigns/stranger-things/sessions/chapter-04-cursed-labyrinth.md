# Chapter 4 - The Cursed Labyrinth

**Location:** The Cursed Labyrinth
**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes - 1 hour
**Type:** Exploration / Puzzle / Random Encounters

## Recap

The heroes have navigated the Troglodyte Caverns (through combat, diplomacy, or cunning) and now enter the Cursed Labyrinth - a magical maze that stands between them and the Upside Down.

## Scene Overview

A magical maze with randomized paths determined by d20 rolls. The party must navigate the shifting corridors and ultimately encounter the Lost Knight, who presents riddles that reveal the passage to the Upside Down.

## Events

### Scene 1: Entering the Labyrinth

> "The rough stone of the caverns gives way to unnaturally smooth walls. The air grows thick and strange. Before you stretches a corridor that seems to shift at the edge of your vision - a maze of impossible geometry. Welcome to the Cursed Labyrinth."

Describe:
- The transition from natural caverns to magical maze
- Walls that seem to move when not directly observed
- An oppressive, otherworldly atmosphere
- The sense that normal navigation won't work here

### Scene 2: Navigating the Maze

Use the random path mechanic (d20 rolls) to determine the party's route. On average, it takes about 40 hallway descriptions before encountering the Lost Knight.

### Scene 3: The Lost Knight

- Encounter the mysterious knight
- Present the two riddles
- Determine success or failure

### Scene 4: Finding the Passage

- Reveal the portal to the Upside Down
- The knight warns it's a one-way trip
- Build anticipation and dread for what's ahead

## The Random Path Mechanic

Each time the party tries to navigate, roll a d20. There's approximately a **3 in 20 chance** of a special encounter; otherwise, the result is a hallway description.

| d20 Roll | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Dead End** - The corridor ends abruptly. Must backtrack. |
| 2-3 | Long straight corridor that turns left after 60 feet |
| 4-5 | Long straight corridor that turns right after 60 feet |
| 6-7 | T-intersection - party must choose left or right |
| 8-9 | Corridor descends a gentle slope, continues 40 feet |
| 10-11 | Four-way intersection - party must choose a direction |
| 12-13 | Corridor ascends a gentle slope, continues 40 feet |
| 14-15 | Curved corridor that spirals around, disorienting |
| 16-17 | Wide chamber with multiple exits - roll again to see which leads forward |
| 18-19 | **Special Encounter** - Roll on the encounter table |
| 20 | **The Lost Knight** - Proceed to the riddle encounter |

### Special Encounters (Roll d6 when indicated)

| d6 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | A mirror that shows the party's reflections doing something different |
| 2 | Whispers in the walls that speak cryptic phrases |
| 3 | A room where gravity shifts unexpectedly |
| 4 | The Proud Princess - an NPC who provides cryptic information (immune to damage) |
| 5 | An illusion of a past failure or fear |
| 6 | The Lost Knight (proceed to riddles) |

## The Proud Princess (Special NPC)

If encountered, the Proud Princess is another bound spirit of the labyrinth:
- **Cannot be harmed** (immune to damage, can't be hit except on critical hit)
- Provides information about the Thessalhydra and its lair
- Speaks in riddles and metaphors
- Can hint at the Lost Knight's location

## The Lost Knight Encounter

See `npcs/the-lost-knight.md` for full details.

**Summary:**
- Location: Deep within the labyrinth
- Appearance: Spectral knight in ancient armor
- Demeanor: Neutral, patient, bound by duty

### Riddle 1: The Chase Paradox

When the party encounters the Lost Knight, he flees, calling out:

> "Catch me if you can! But know this: **The front is the back. Hello is goodbye.**"

**Solution:** Stop chasing. Turn around and go back. The knight appears before them.

**Hints (if struggling):**
- "You seem to be getting nowhere."
- "Remember my words: the front is the back."
- Allow a DC 12 Intelligence check for a hint

### Riddle 2: The Blackbird Statues

The knight leads them to a chamber with 24 blackbird statues on shelves, one empty space.

> "Four-and-twenty blackbirds, baked in a pie. One has left its shelf. Place the correct one, or face the sky's wrath."

**Solution:** Reference to "Sing a Song of Sixpence" nursery rhyme. Players must identify the correct statue.

**Failure Consequence:** 2d6 lightning damage to all (DC 13 DEX save for half). Can retry.

**Hints:**
- Reference to the nursery rhyme is the key
- DC 10 Intelligence (History) check to recall the rhyme
- Bard with Jack of All Trades has advantage

### Success: The Passage Opens

> "You have proven yourselves worthy. The passage to the Upside Down awaits. But know this - the way through is one direction only. You must find another path home."

A portal shimmers into existence - dark, unsettling, leading somewhere *wrong*.

## NPCs Encountered

| Name | Disposition | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| The Lost Knight | Neutral | Riddle guardian, immune to damage |
| The Proud Princess | Neutral | Information source, immune to damage |

## Combat Encounters

Combat is rare in the labyrinth. The maze itself is the challenge.

| Encounter | Enemies | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| None standard | N/A | The labyrinth tests wit, not strength |

## DM Notes

### Running the Labyrinth

**Option 1: Full Random (by the book)**
Roll for each navigation attempt. This can take a while (~40 rolls on average).

**Option 2: Montage Approach (recommended)**
Describe the labyrinth as a confusing montage:
- "The corridors twist and turn. You swear you've passed that same crack in the wall three times."
- Ask players to describe how they're trying to navigate
- Let them use skills (Survival, Investigation) for narrative effect
- After sufficient exploration, trigger the Lost Knight encounter

**Option 3: Skill Challenge**
Require 5 successes before 3 failures on DC 12 checks:
- Wisdom (Survival) to track direction
- Intelligence (Investigation) to spot patterns
- Charisma (Performance) to keep spirits up
- Success leads to the Lost Knight; failure adds encounters

### The Riddles

- Give players time to discuss
- Allow creative interpretations that show understanding
- Provide hints if they're truly stuck
- Don't let this section drag - the goal is fun, not frustration
- If players are completely stuck after 10 minutes, have the knight repeat key phrases

### Atmosphere

The labyrinth should feel:
- **Disorienting** - Normal logic doesn't apply
- **Magical** - This is not a natural place
- **Building Dread** - The Upside Down awaits

## Transition

When the passage to the Upside Down is revealed:

> "The portal before you is wrong in every way. The air that seeps through it is cold and stale. Beyond, you see a twisted mirror of reality - the same corridors, but dark, organic, corrupted. The Upside Down awaits."

Proceed to **Chapter 5: The Upside Down**
