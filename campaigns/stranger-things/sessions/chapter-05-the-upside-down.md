# Chapter 5 - The Upside Down

**Location:** The Upside Down
**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Type:** Horror / Exploration / Boss Combat

## Recap

The heroes solved the Lost Knight's riddles and discovered the passage to the Upside Down - a dark, twisted mirror dimension. Now they must navigate this nightmarish realm, possibly encounter the Proud Princess, and face the Demogorgon before finding the exit to the Thessalhydra's lair.

## Scene Overview

A horror-themed transitional zone featuring the iconic Upside Down from Stranger Things. The atmosphere is oppressive and wrong. The party may encounter the Proud Princess (information NPC) and must face or evade the Demogorgon before reaching the final area.

**Designer Note:** The Upside Down is designed to feel "scary but not necessarily dangerous" - atmosphere over lethality.

## Events

### Scene 1: Entering the Upside Down

> "You step through the portal and immediately know something is wrong. The world is the same... but not. The corridor you stand in mirrors the labyrinth, but the walls are organic, pulsing with dark veins. Floating particles drift through the air like snow made of ash. Everything is bathed in a sickly blue-gray light that seems to come from nowhere. The air is cold, stale, and tastes of decay."

**Environmental Description:**
- Darkness or dim lighting everywhere
- Floating particles (like the Netflix show)
- Organic corruption covering surfaces
- Twisted reflections of reality
- Sound is muffled, distorted
- Temperature fluctuates uncomfortably

**Party Reactions:**
- DC 10 Wisdom save or be Frightened for 1 minute (one-time, on entry)
- The environment is unsettling but not immediately hostile

---

### Scene 2: Navigating the Realm

> "The passages here twist in ways that shouldn't be possible. The walls breathe. Distant sounds echo - is that a growl? A scream? The wind? Navigation is difficult; your senses feel unreliable."

**Environmental Effects:**

| Effect | Mechanic |
|--------|----------|
| Dim Light | Disadvantage on Perception checks relying on sight |
| Muffled Sound | Disadvantage on Perception checks relying on hearing |
| Disorienting | DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) to navigate effectively |
| Oppressive | Short rests take twice as long |

**Signs of the Demogorgon:**
- Claw marks on organic walls
- Partially consumed remains of... something
- Distant roars that seem to come from everywhere
- The smell of blood

---

### Scene 3: The Proud Princess (Optional Encounter)

If the party explores or rolls the right random encounter:

> "In a small chamber off the main passage, you find a strange sight: a spectral woman in tattered noble garb, sitting on what was once a throne. She looks up as you enter, her eyes holding ancient knowledge. 'More seekers,' she says. 'How curious.'"

**The Proud Princess:**
- Another bound spirit, like the Lost Knight
- **Cannot be harmed** (immune to damage, can't be hit except on critical hit)
- Provides information about the Thessalhydra and its lair
- Speaks in riddles and metaphors

**What She Shares:**
- "The beast you seek has eight minds but one hunger. Fire is its bane - without flame, it cannot die."
- "The shadow-walker hunts in this place. It smells blood. Do not bleed where it can find you."
- "The way out lies beyond the hunter's domain. You must pass through, not around."
- "The blade of dark metal... it was made for this place. Here, it is strongest."

**Roleplay Notes:**
- Speak with melancholy and distant wisdom
- She has been here for ages, watching travelers come and go
- She cannot leave the Upside Down
- If asked about herself: "I was a princess once. Now I am... advice."

### Scene 4: The Demogorgon Encounter

> "A roar splits the oppressive silence - close, too close. From the organic walls, a shape emerges. Humanoid but wrong, with elongated limbs and pale, grayish skin. Its head... its head opens like a flower, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth. The Demogorgon has found you."

**See `npcs/demogorgon.md` for full stat block.**

**Quick Reference:**
- AC 15, HP 95, Speed 40 ft.
- Multiattack: 1 Bite (+7, 1d8+3) + 2 Claws (+7, 2d8+3 each)
- **Keen Smell:** Advantage on smell-based Perception
- **Blood Frenzy:** Advantage on attacks vs. wounded creatures
- **Regeneration:** 10 HP/turn (stopped by acid/fire)

### Tactics

1. **Stalking Phase:** The Demogorgon stalks the party first, building tension
2. **Ambush:** It attacks from an unexpected direction
3. **Blood Frenzy:** Focuses on wounded characters
4. **Regeneration:** Fights recklessly, knowing it heals

### Victory Conditions

**Important:** Players don't need to fully defeat the Demogorgon.

1. **Full Victory:** Reduce to 0 HP while it can't regenerate (requires fire/acid damage in previous turn)
2. **Wound and Escape:** Deal significant damage (below half HP), then find the exit while it recovers
3. **Distraction:** Create a diversion and flee

> "Once they defeat it (or even just wound it a bit) they can exit the Upside Down and enter the lair of the Thessalhydra."

### Scene 5: Finding the Exit

After dealing with the Demogorgon:

> "Beyond where the Demogorgon emerged, you see it - a tear in reality, its edges crackling with strange energy. Through it, you glimpse normal stone walls. The exit from this nightmare. But what lies beyond may be worse."

**The Exit:**
- A portal/rift leading to the Thessalhydra's lair
- One-way passage (cannot return through this exit)
- DC 13 Arcana to understand its nature

## Winter's Dark Bite (Special Weapon)

The magical greatsword given by Sir Tristan has special properties here:

> **Winter's Dark Bite**
> *Weapon (greatsword), rare*

| Location | Bonus |
|----------|-------|
| Normal (Material Plane) | +1 greatsword |
| Against the Thessalhydra | +3 greatsword |
| **In the Upside Down** | **+4 greatsword** |

**Description:** A greatsword made of an unknown black metal that seems to consume light. The material originates from the Upside Down itself.

**In the Upside Down:**
- The blade seems more solid, more real than its surroundings
- It cuts through the Demogorgon's flesh with supernatural ease
- The highest bonus weapon in standard 5e

## DM Notes

### Creating Atmosphere

**Do:**
- Describe everything as wrong and corrupted
- Use uncomfortable sensory details (the smell, the cold, the wrongness)
- Build dread before the Demogorgon appears
- Make the Demogorgon feel like a relentless hunter
- Reference the Stranger Things aesthetic if players know it

**Don't:**
- Make the environment directly deadly (it's scary, not a deathtrap)
- Let the Demogorgon fight drag on too long
- Forget that escape is a valid option

### The Demogorgon Fight

- This is the penultimate boss, not the finale
- Resource depletion before the Thessalhydra is intentional
- The "wound and escape" option exists for pacing
- Use the environment (organic walls, shifting terrain)
- If the party is struggling, have the exit become visible
- Winter's Dark Bite should feel powerful here

### The Proud Princess

- She's optional but provides valuable information
- Don't force the encounter, but make it available
- Her hints about fire and the weapon are important
- She adds to the mysterious lore of the Upside Down

### Pacing

- Don't spend too long here - 30-45 minutes max
- The tension should build to the Demogorgon, then release
- The exit should feel like relief
- But remind them: the Thessalhydra awaits

---

## Transition

Upon exiting the Upside Down:

> "You stumble through the portal, gasping as normal air fills your lungs. The oppressive weight of the Upside Down lifts from your shoulders. But as your eyes adjust, you realize you're not safe. You stand in a cavern, its walls slick with moisture and something else - acid, you realize, as you see the pitted stone. The air carries a sulfurous tang. And from somewhere deeper in the cavern, you hear it: a chorus of hissing, serpentine voices. The Thessalhydra knows you're here."
