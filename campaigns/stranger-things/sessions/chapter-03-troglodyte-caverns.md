## The 11 Areas

### Area 1: Cavern Entrance

> "The cave mouth yawns before you, a jagged opening in the hillside. The stench of rot and something reptilian wafts from within. The floor slopes downward into darkness."

**Contents:**
- Empty initially
- Evidence of passage (claw marks, scales)
- DC 12 Perception: Notice troglodyte scouts retreating deeper

**Exits:** Tunnel leads to Area 2

---

### Area 2: Guard Post

> "The tunnel opens into a small chamber. Crude barricades of stone and bone block the far passage. Behind them, reptilian eyes gleam in your light."

**Encounter:** 3 Troglodyte Scouts
- They attempt to alert others if possible
- Will flee to Area 4 if outmatched

**Treasure:** None

**Exits:** Back to Area 1, forward to Area 3 or Area 4

---

### Area 3: Spider Den

> "Thick webs coat the walls and ceiling of this side passage. Bones - some humanoid - are wrapped in silk cocoons. Something large moves in the shadows above."

**Encounter:** 2 Giant Spiders
- Web terrain: Difficult terrain, DC 12 STR or restrained if entering
- Spiders attempt to web and drag isolated targets

- Web (Recharge 5-6): +5 to hit, range 30/60, restrained (DC 12 STR to escape)

---

### Area 4: Troglodyte Living Quarters

> "This larger cavern is clearly inhabited. Crude sleeping pallets line the walls, and the remains of a recent meal - you'd rather not know what - sit near a small fire pit. Several troglodytes look up at your arrival."

**Encounter:** 5 Troglodytes + 3 Non-combatants
- Non-combatants (young/elderly) flee immediately
- Warriors fight but check morale when 3 are defeated
- If parley is called, they send for the King (Area 7)

**Treasure:** 20 gp worth of shiny trinkets, mostly worthless

**Exits:** Tunnels to Areas 2, 5, 6, and 7

---

### Area 5: Hunting Storage

> "Animal carcasses hang from hooks driven into the rock. Some are fresh; others are in various states of decay. This appears to be a food storage area."

**Contents:**
- No enemies (unless party is hostile to tribe)
- Food supplies (unappetizing but edible if desperate)
- DC 14 Perception: Hidden nook containing 15 gp and a hunting trap

**Exits:** Back to Area 4

---

### Area 6: The Ochre Jelly Cave

> "This cave has an unnatural sheen to the walls. The stone looks... melted, somehow. The air burns slightly in your nostrils. In the center of the chamber, a glistening yellow mass pulses slowly."

**Encounter:** 1 Ochre Jelly
- The jelly attacks anything that moves
- When damaged by slashing or lightning, splits into two smaller jellies
- Troglodytes avoid this area

**Environmental Hazard:**
- Acid pools (2d6 acid damage on contact)

- **Split:** When hit by lightning or slashing while at 10+ HP, splits into two jellies with half HP

---

### Area 7: The King's Chamber

> "This chamber is larger and cleaner than the others. A raised platform serves as a throne of sorts, where a larger troglodyte sits watching you with intelligent, calculating eyes. Guards flank him, but he raises a clawed hand - a signal to wait."

**Key NPC:** The Troglodyte King (Sketh-Kra)
- Speaks Common (the only troglodyte who does)
- Pragmatic and willing to negotiate
- Guards: 4 Troglodyte Warriors

**Negotiation Opportunity:**
The King offers:
- Safe passage through the caverns
- Information about what lies ahead
- Guidance to the Cursed Labyrinth entrance

In exchange:
- The party leaves his people alone
- Optionally: Kill the giant spiders (Area 3) and/or ochre jelly (Area 6) that threaten his tribe

**If Combat:**
- The King fights last, allowing guards to engage first
- If outmatched, he surrenders and offers the deal above

**Treasure (if taken by force):** 80 gp, crude golden crown (worth 25 gp), bone jewelry

**Exits:** To Areas 4, 8, and a secret passage to Area 11

---

### Area 8: The Deep Passage

> "The tunnel here slopes sharply downward. The walls are slick with moisture, and the temperature drops noticeably. This leads away from the troglodyte territory, deeper into the earth."

**Contents:**
- No enemies
- Travel passage between upper and lower caverns
- DC 12 Athletics to descend safely; failure means sliding and taking 1d6 damage

**Exits:** To Areas 6 (secret), 7, and 9

---

### Area 9: Underground Pool

> "A dark pool fills most of this cavern, fed by a waterfall from somewhere above. The water is cold but clear. Something glints at the bottom."

**Contents:**
- No enemies (unless the party is particularly noisy)
- Fresh water source
- Underwater treasure: 25 gp, waterlogged journal (contains hints about the labyrinth)

**Hazard:** The pool is 15 feet deep. DC 12 Athletics to retrieve items from the bottom.

**Exits:** To Areas 8 and 10

---

### Area 10: Thessalhydra Worshippers

> "This small shrine is decorated with crude cave paintings depicting a many-headed serpent. A few troglodytes kneel before a primitive altar, hissing prayers to their 'god.'"

**Encounter:** 3 Troglodyte Zealots
- These troglodytes worship the Thessalhydra
- They do NOT answer to the King
- They attack on sight, believing intruders defile their holy place

**Treasure:**
- Altar offerings: 40 gp, crude idol of the Thessalhydra (worth 10 gp to collectors)

**Information:**
- Cave paintings show the Thessalhydra's lair (confirms 8 heads)
- Paintings also show a dark portal - the Upside Down

**Exits:** To Areas 9 and 11

---

### Area 11: Exit to the Cursed Labyrinth

> "The tunnel opens into a final chamber. The far wall is different from the rest - unnaturally smooth, almost polished. Strange symbols are carved around an archway that seems to shimmer slightly. Beyond, the passage continues, but something feels... wrong about it."

**Contents:**
- No enemies
- The exit to the Cursed Labyrinth
- Magical threshold (DC 13 Arcana to identify as planar transition point)

**The Troglodyte King's Guidance:**
If allied with the King, he accompanies them here:
> "Beyond lies the Cursed Labyrinth. My people do not enter there. The paths... they do not stay still. Be wary, surface-dwellers. What you seek lies beyond, but so does death."

**Exits:** Back to Areas 7 (secret) and 10; forward to the Cursed Labyrinth (Chapter 4)

## DM Notes

### Pacing
- This is the longest chapter - consider short rest opportunities
- Don't drag out every room - some can be quickly described
- Focus on Areas 3, 6, 7, and 10 for major encounters
- The diplomacy route should feel rewarding, not like skipping content

### Atmosphere
- Emphasize darkness, stench, and alien environment
- The troglodytes are dangerous but understandable
- The ochre jelly is mindlessly deadly
- The zealots in Area 10 are fanatical

### Resource Drain
- This dungeon should use some party resources
- But not so much they can't handle the remaining adventure
- The King's alliance helps with this balance

## Transition

When the party enters the archway in Area 11:

> "As you pass through the archway, the air shimmers and shifts. The rough stone of the caverns gives way to unnaturally smooth walls. The temperature seems to fluctuate randomly. You have entered the Cursed Labyrinth."
