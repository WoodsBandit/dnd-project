## Events

### Scene 1: Setting Out

> "The road stretches before you, winding through farmland and forest. The sun is bright, but the air carries an autumn chill. Other travelers share the road - farmers with carts, merchants with goods, wanderers seeking shelter. Perhaps some of them know something useful about what lies ahead."

**Describe:**
- The journey atmosphere (pleasant but ominous)
- Other travelers on the road
- Signs of the Thessalhydra's depredations (burned farms in the distance)
- First opportunity for party conversation

### Scene 2: NPC Encounters

The party can meet four different travelers. See `npcs/road-npcs.md` for full details.

---

#### NPC 1: Brother Aldric (Traveling Priest)

> "A middle-aged man in simple brown robes approaches, leading a small cart. He raises a hand in greeting. 'Well met, travelers. You have the look of adventurers about you. Heading toward the mountains, perhaps?'"

**Key Information:**
- The Thessalhydra has many heads
- Fire may be essential against it
- Reptilian creatures dwell in the caves ahead

**Roleplay Notes:**
- Speaks slowly and deliberately
- May offer to bless the party
- Genuinely concerned for their safety

---

#### NPC 2: Old Marta (Displaced Farmer)

> "An elderly woman sits by the roadside, a small bundle of possessions beside her. Her eyes are haunted, her hands never still. She looks up as you pass. 'Are you... are you the ones going after that thing?'"

**Key Information:**
- She saw the Thessalhydra from a distance
- It spits acid that dissolved her livestock
- Previous adventurers sent by Sir Tristan never returned

**Roleplay Notes:**
- Speaks quickly, nervously
- Traumatized but grateful to talk to armed travelers
- May give the party her late husband's lucky copper piece

---

#### NPC 3: Garrett the Merchant

> "A colorful wagon approaches, driven by a portly man with a ready smile. 'Ho there, friends! Garrett's the name, trade's the game. Looking to buy? Looking to sell? Or just looking for information?'"

**Key Information:**
- The road ahead gets dangerous past the old mill
- There may be a back entrance to the caves (partial truth)
- Sir Tristan has sent many adventurers - they haven't returned

**Roleplay Notes:**
- Speaks with a salesman's charm
- Will sell supplies at fair prices
- Admits he's never been inside the caves

---

#### NPC 4: Elira the Woodcutter's Daughter

> "A young woman in hunting leathers pauses as you approach. She carries a bow and moves with the confidence of someone comfortable in the wilderness. Her eyes assess you quickly. 'You're heading for the caves.'"

**Key Information:**
- The "lizard-folk" are territorial but can be intimidated
- Giant webs and acid trails in the caves suggest other dangers
- Fire is useful against both the lizard-folk and whatever made the webs

**Roleplay Notes:**
- Speaks plainly and directly
- Respects competence over titles
- May offer to guide the party to the cave entrance

---

### Scene 3: Approach to the Caverns

After the NPC encounters:

> "The road narrows as the trees grow thicker. The cheerful warmth of the travelers fades behind you. Ahead, the forest darkens, and you spot the black mouth of a cave yawning in the hillside. The air carries a faint, unpleasant smell - like rotting meat and sulfur. You have arrived at the Troglodyte Caverns."

## DM Notes

### Running the Encounters

**Order:** Present the NPCs in any order, or let players choose who to approach. Not all four need to be encountered - 2-3 is sufficient.

**Pacing:** Keep each encounter to 5-10 minutes. These are meant to build atmosphere and provide information, not become lengthy scenes.

**Information Control:** The most important information is:
1. The Thessalhydra has multiple heads and regenerates
2. Fire is useful/essential
3. There are dangerous creatures in the caves
4. Diplomacy with troglodytes is possible

### Adjustments

- If the party is rushing, have one NPC approach them
- If they're thorough, reward investigation with bonus details
- If they're rude to NPCs, that NPC's information may be withheld
- Combat with NPCs should be avoided - they flee if threatened

### Atmosphere

- The road should feel like the calm before the storm
- Each NPC adds to the sense of danger ahead
- The transition to the caves should feel ominous

---

## Transition

As the party approaches the cavern entrance:

> "The cave mouth yawns before you, a jagged opening in the hillside. The stench of rot and something reptilian wafts from within. The road ends here. From this point forward, there is no path but the one you make. The Troglodyte Caverns await."

Proceed to **Chapter 3: Troglodyte Caverns**
