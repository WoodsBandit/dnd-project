## Events

### Scene 1: Arrival at Court

> "The great hall of Crabapple Valley Castle stretches before you, its stone walls hung with tapestries depicting heroic deeds of ages past. Torches cast dancing shadows across the floor as you approach the raised dais at the far end. There, seated upon an ornate wooden throne, sits Sir Tristan - lord of these lands and the man who summoned you here. His eyes are tired but hopeful as he watches you approach."

**Describe:**
- The grandeur of the throne room
- Sir Tristan's noble but weary appearance
- Guards and servants in attendance
- The atmosphere of urgency and hope

### Scene 2: The Quest Briefing

Sir Tristan rises from his throne and speaks:

> "I am Sir Tristan of the Crabapple Valley. I thank you for answering my summons. I would not have called upon adventurers if the situation were not dire."

**The Threat:**
> "A creature of terrible power has made its lair in the mountains beyond our borders. A Thessalhydra - a serpentine horror with eight heads, each capable of independent thought and attack. It has attacked my castle, killed my soldiers, and terrorized the people of this valley. Farms burned. Livestock slaughtered. Lives lost. And each time we think we've wounded it, it returns, stronger than before."

**The Mission:**
> "I need heroes. I need you to hunt this creature to its lair and destroy it. Bring me the creature's heads as proof of your victory, and you shall be rewarded handsomely."

**The Reward:**
> "I am willing to pay you each **one hundred gold pieces for every head** you bring back. The Thessalhydra has eight heads - that is eight hundred gold, split among you all. Additionally, I shall cover all expenses for your journey and provide you with equipment for the task."

### Scene 3: Equipment Distribution

Sir Tristan gestures to his servants, who bring forward equipment:

> "Take these gifts - you will need them where you are going."

**Equipment Provided:**

| Item | Recipient | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Rings of Protection | All party members | +1 AC while worn |
| Potions of Healing | All party members | 2d4+2 HP each |
| Winter's Dark Bite | Martial character (Paladin) | Magical greatsword, +1/+3/+4 |
| Wand of Magic Missiles | Spellcaster (Wizard) | 7 charges, standard wand |
| Bags of Holding (x2) | Party | For carrying treasure and heads |

**About Winter's Dark Bite:**
> "This blade is called Winter's Dark Bite. It was forged from metal found in the dark realm beyond our world. Against normal foes, it strikes true. Against the Thessalhydra, it strikes with the fury of winter itself. And in the shadow realm... it is strongest of all."

### Scene 4: Questions and Departure

**Questions the Party Might Ask:**

| Question | Sir Tristan's Answer |
|----------|---------------------|
| Where is the Thessalhydra? | "Its lair lies beyond the troglodyte caverns and through a cursed labyrinth. The path is dangerous but passable." |
| What do we know about it? | "Eight heads. It spits acid. It regenerates unless... I believe fire can stop its healing." |
| Have others tried? | "I have sent soldiers and adventurers before. None have returned. You are my last hope." |
| What are the troglodytes? | "Reptilian creatures that dwell in the caves. They are dangerous but reportedly can be reasoned with. Their leader may speak our tongue." |
| The cursed labyrinth? | "A magical maze. I know little of it, except that it lies between the caverns and the creature's domain." |

**Accepting the Quest:**
Once the party accepts:

> "Then go with my blessing, heroes of Crabapple Valley. Return victorious, and your names shall be sung in these halls for generations. Return with the creature's heads, and you shall have your reward - and my eternal gratitude."

## DM Notes

### Pacing

Keep this section moving - it's setup, not the adventure itself.

**Key Goals:**
1. Establish the quest clearly
2. Get players excited about the challenge
3. Distribute starting equipment
4. Move to the road section

**Avoid:**
- Getting bogged down in court politics
- Extended shopping or preparation scenes
- Long debates about whether to accept
- Lengthy exposition about the kingdom's history

### Atmosphere

- Sir Tristan should feel noble but desperate
- The threat should feel real and dangerous
- The reward should feel generous and tempting
- The equipment should feel like meaningful gifts

### The Equipment

**Winter's Dark Bite** is the signature item of the adventure:
- Give it to the character most likely to be in melee (Paladin recommended)
- Explain its scaling properties clearly
- It's meant to make the final fights feel epic

**The Bags of Holding** are practical:
- Allow the party to carry loot
- Essential for transporting 8 Thessalhydra heads back

## Transition

After accepting the quest and departing:

> "You leave Sir Tristan's castle behind, the weight of your quest settling on your shoulders. The castle gates close behind you with a resonant boom. Before you stretches the road that leads toward the mountains, toward danger, and hopefully, toward glory. The Hunt for the Thessalhydra has begun."
