## Character Notes

### Starting Level
All characters begin at Level 3, which provides:
- Access to subclass features (for most classes)
- More hit points than Level 1
- A broader range of abilities
- Better survivability for the adventure

### Advancement
Characters can level up to Level 5 during or after the adventure. The Starter Set Rulebook covers rules through Level 5.

### Connection to Stranger Things
The pre-generated characters are inspired by the D&D personas mentioned in the show:
- **Will the Wise** (Cleric) - Will Byers' character
- **Dustin the Dwarf** (Bard-like energy) - Dustin's character
- The other characters connect to the party's play styles

## Party Composition

The five characters provide a balanced party:
- **Tank/Melee:** Paladin
- **Support/Healing:** Cleric
- **Ranged/Utility:** Ranger
- **Arcane Magic:** Wizard
- **Utility/Face:** Bard

This composition can handle combat, exploration, and social encounters effectively.

- Full ability scores and modifiers
