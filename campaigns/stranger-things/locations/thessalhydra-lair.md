# The Thessalhydra's Lair

**Type:** Monster Lair / Final Dungeon
**Region:** Beyond the Upside Down
**Population:** The Thessalhydra, Troglodyte Worshippers
**Government:** N/A - Apex predator territory

## Description

> "You emerge from the portal into a cavern that reeks of acid and death. The walls are pitted and scarred, clearly corroded over time. Bones litter the floor - the remains of many meals. A tunnel leads deeper into darkness, and you hear distant hissing."

The final destination of the quest - the lair of the Thessalhydra. This is where the climactic boss battle takes place.

## Stranger Things Connection

The Thessalhydra is directly referenced in the Season 1 finale of Stranger Things. In that scene, the kids finish a D&D session where Will rolls to attack the Thessalhydra, but the result is left ambiguous as real-world concerns interrupt.

This adventure brings that campaign to its intended conclusion.

## Lair Layout (7 Areas)

### Area 1: Lair Entrance
Evidence of the Thessalhydra's presence (acid damage, bones). No immediate enemies. DC 12 Perception notices troglodyte tracks. Acid residue on some surfaces (1d4 acid damage if touched).

### Area 2: Worshipper Outpost
Small chamber with crude torches. **Encounter:** 4 Troglodyte Worshippers who fight to the death. **Treasure:** 30 gp, ritual components.

### Area 3: Acid Pool Chamber
Dominated by bubbling yellow acid pool. Narrow ledges along walls. DC 12 Acrobatics to cross; failure = fall into acid (4d6 damage). Acid vapors: DC 12 CON or Poisoned for 1 minute. **Treasure:** Ring of Acid Resistance at bottom (75 gp in coins nearby).

### Area 4: The Feeding Chamber
Overwhelming stench, half-dissolved carcasses, remains of previous adventurers. **Treasure (DC 14 Investigation):** 50 gp, longsword +1, 2 Potions of Healing, torn journal describing Thessalhydra's habits.

### Area 5: The Inner Sanctum
Larger passage with crude paintings of many-headed serpent. **Encounter:** 3 Troglodyte Zealots + 1 Shaman (HP 26, AC 12, cleric-like spells). **Treasure:** Shaman's staff (25 gp), holy symbol (15 gp).

### Area 6: Treasury Alcove
Troglodyte treasure storage. **Treasure:** 200 gp in coins/gems, silver necklace (50 gp), Potion of Fire Resistance, Scroll of Fireball. **Critical:** These items are intentionally placed to help with the final fight!

### Area 7: The Thessalhydra's Chamber (Boss Arena)

> "The passage opens into a vast cavern, its ceiling lost in darkness above. Pools of acid dot the floor, and the walls are scarred by countless claw marks and acid burns. At the center, coiled around a pile of bones and treasure, lies your quarry: the Thessalhydra. Eight serpentine heads rise from its massive body, each pair of eyes fixing on you with predatory hunger. The hunt ends here."

### Setup
The Thessalhydra is coiled around its treasure hoard. It notices intruders immediately and attacks.

### Thessalhydra Tactics
1. Opens with Acid Saliva on grouped enemies
2. Focuses Flurry of Bites on wounded targets
3. Uses Tail Pincer on biggest threat (spellcasters, healers)
4. Takes advantage of regeneration to outlast the party

### Victory Conditions

- Regains 10 HP per head regrown
- **FIRE STOPS REGENERATION**

### Alternative Outcomes

- **Returns to:** Sir Tristan's Throne Room (for reward)

## DM Notes

**This is the climax of the entire adventure. Make it memorable!**

**Before the Fight:**
- Build tension as they approach
- Describe the lair with vivid detail
- Let the Thessalhydra's presence be felt before it's seen

**During the Fight:**
- Track heads carefully (use tokens or counter)
- Remind players about fire damage if they forget
- Use the environment (acid pools, stalactites)
- The fight should be challenging but winnable
- If too easy, use lair actions more aggressively
- If too hard, have some heads already damaged

**After Victory:**
- Let players enjoy their triumph
- The return journey can be a quick montage
- The reward scene should feel satisfying
- Close character arcs if possible

**Making Each Player Shine:**
- Paladin: Winter's Dark Bite is devastating (+3 bonus)
- Wizard: Fireball scroll and spells are crucial
- Cleric: Healing keeps the party standing
- Ranger: Ranged attacks and tactical positioning
- Bard: Inspiration and support spells
