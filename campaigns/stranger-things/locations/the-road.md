## DM Notes

**Purpose:**
The "Rumors on the Road" section serves several purposes:
1. Provides roleplay opportunities before combat begins
2. Allows information gathering about dangers ahead
3. Sets atmosphere and builds tension
4. Gives players agency in how they prepare
5. Breaks up the dungeon-heavy adventure

**Running the Encounters:**
- Present NPCs in any order, or let players choose who to approach
- Not all four need to be encountered - 2-3 is sufficient
- Keep each encounter to 5-10 minutes
- These build atmosphere and provide info, not lengthy scenes

**Information Control:**
The most important information is:
1. The Thessalhydra has multiple heads and regenerates
2. Fire is useful/essential
3. There are dangerous creatures in the caves
4. Diplomacy with troglodytes is possible

**Adjustments:**
- If party is rushing, have one NPC approach them
- If they're thorough, reward investigation with bonus details
- If they're rude to NPCs, that NPC's information may be withheld
- Combat with NPCs should be avoided - they flee if threatened

**Atmosphere:**
- The road should feel like the calm before the storm
- Each NPC adds to the sense of danger ahead
- The transition to the caves should feel ominous

**Transition:**
> "The road narrows as the trees grow thicker. The cheerful warmth of the travelers fades behind you. Ahead, the forest darkens, and you spot the black mouth of a cave yawning in the hillside. The air carries a faint, unpleasant smell - like rotting meat and sulfur. You have arrived at the Troglodyte Caverns."
