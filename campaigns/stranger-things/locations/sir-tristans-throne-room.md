## DM Notes

**This scene establishes:**
- The quest hook
- The party's motivation
- The stakes and rewards
- The starting tone of the adventure

**Pacing:**
- Keep this section moving (15-30 minutes)
- It's setup, not the adventure itself
- Get players excited about the challenge
- Distribute equipment efficiently

**Avoid:**
- Getting bogged down in court politics
- Extended shopping or preparation scenes
- Long debates about whether to accept
- Lengthy exposition about the kingdom's history

**Atmosphere:**
- Sir Tristan should feel noble but desperate
- The threat should feel real and dangerous
- The reward should feel generous and tempting
- The equipment should feel like meaningful gifts

**Winter's Dark Bite:**
- Give it to the character most likely to be in melee (Paladin)
- Explain its scaling properties clearly
- It's meant to make the final fights feel epic

**Transition:**
> "You leave Sir Tristan's castle behind, the weight of your quest settling on your shoulders. The castle gates close behind you with a resonant boom. Before you stretches the road that leads toward the mountains, toward danger, and hopefully, toward glory. The Hunt for the Thessalhydra has begun."
