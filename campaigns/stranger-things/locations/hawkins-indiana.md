# Hawkins, Indiana (Meta-Location)

**Type:** Real-world setting inspiration
**Era:** 1980s
**Population:** Small town America
**Context:** The framing device for the Stranger Things D&D Starter Set

## Overview

While the Hunt for the Thessalhydra takes place in a fantasy realm, the entire adventure is presented as being created by Mike Wheeler, a middle school student in Hawkins, Indiana in the 1980s.

This meta-location provides context for the adventure's aesthetic and themes.

## Hawkins in the Show

Hawkins is the fictional small town in Indiana where Stranger Things takes place. Key locations include:

### Hawkins Middle School
Where Mike, Dustin, Lucas, and Will attend school and often play D&D after hours or in their free time.

### The Wheeler Basement
Mike's basement is the primary location for D&D sessions. The iconic image of the kids around the table comes from here.

### Hawkins National Laboratory
The source of the supernatural threats in the show, and indirectly the inspiration for the "Upside Down" appearing in Mike's campaign.

### The Upside Down
In the show, this is an actual alternate dimension. In the D&D adventure, it's a location Mike incorporated into his campaign, likely inspired by real events.

## 1980s D&D Culture

The Stranger Things era represents:
- **Red Box D&D:** The classic Basic Set that many players started with
- **Satanic Panic:** The era when D&D faced moral panic (referenced in the show)
- **Handwritten Campaigns:** Before digital tools, everything was notebooks and graph paper
- **Imagination-Forward:** Theater of the mind over battle maps

## Thematic Connections

Mike's campaign (this adventure) reflects:
1. Classic dungeon-crawling structure
2. Clear good vs. evil narrative
3. Heroic quest framework
4. Monsters drawn from D&D lore
5. The power of friendship and teamwork

## The Thessalhydra's Significance

In Stranger Things Season 1, the kids' final D&D session before Will's disappearance features the Thessalhydra. The ambiguous ending of that game mirrors the unresolved supernatural events. When they return to playing later, the Thessalhydra represents:
- Unfinished business
- Return to normalcy
- The ongoing battle against evil

## DM Notes for Atmosphere

To capture the Stranger Things feel:
- Reference 1980s culture if appropriate
- Emphasize friendship and teamwork themes
- Create moments of genuine tension and horror
- Allow for heroic moments
- Remember that the adventure is "by" a kid - embrace classic tropes

The physical adventure book is designed to look like Mike's handwritten journal, reinforcing this framing.

## Locations NOT in the Adventure

These show locations are NOT part of the D&D campaign but provide context:
- Mirkwood (the forest road)
- Castle Byers (Will's fort)
- The Quarry
- Starcourt Mall (later seasons)

The adventure exists as fantasy, separate from but inspired by the real-world (within the show) events of Hawkins.
