## DM Notes

**Pacing:**
- This is the longest chapter (1-2 hours)
- Focus on Areas 3, 6, 7, and 10 for major encounters
- Don't drag out every room
- Diplomacy should feel rewarding, not like skipping content

**Combat Balance:**
- Resource drain is intentional but shouldn't deplete party completely
- The King's alliance helps maintain balance
- Multiple solutions exist for most encounters

**Remember:**
- Morale matters - troglodytes may flee or negotiate
- Failure rarely ends the adventure
- Encourage creative problem-solving
