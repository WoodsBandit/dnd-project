# The Cursed Labyrinth

**Type:** Dungeon / Magical Maze
**Region:** Between the Caverns and the Upside Down
**Population:** The Lost Knight (bound spirit)
**Government:** N/A - Magical construct

## Description

> "As you pass through the archway, the air shimmers and shifts. The rough stone of the caverns gives way to unnaturally smooth walls. The temperature seems to fluctuate randomly. You have entered the Cursed Labyrinth."

A magical maze with shifting paths determined by dice rolls. The labyrinth contains the crucial meeting with the Lost Knight, who holds the key to reaching the Upside Down.

## Unique Mechanic: Random Paths

The Cursed Labyrinth uses a d20 roll to determine what players encounter:

| d20 Roll | Path Result |
|----------|-------------|
| 1-4 | Dead End - Must backtrack, roll again |
| 5-8 | Winding Path - Safe but time-consuming, roll again |
| 9-12 | Strange Chamber - Eerie room with unsettling features, roll again |
| 13-16 | Lost Knight Encounter - Proceed to riddle challenge |
| 17-20 | Direct Path - Find the Lost Knight immediately |

**DM Options:**
- Use the random table for unpredictability
- Guarantee the Lost Knight encounter after 2-3 rolls
- Skip the randomness entirely and go straight to the Lost Knight

## The Lost Knight Encounter

**Location:** Central chamber of the labyrinth

The Lost Knight is a spectral armored figure who guards the passage to the Upside Down. He cannot be harmed (immune to damage except on critical hits, which only disrupt his form briefly).

## The Riddles

### Riddle 1: The Chase Paradox

The Lost Knight flees down a corridor, calling out:

> "Catch me if you can! But know this: **The front is the back. Hello is goodbye.**"

**The Puzzle:** If players chase, they never catch up - the knight always escapes around corners.

**The Solution:** Stop chasing and turn around. Go **back the way you came**. The Lost Knight will appear before them.

### Riddle 2: The Blackbird Statues

After solving the first riddle, the Lost Knight leads them to a chamber with blackbird statues:

> "Four-and-twenty blackbirds, baked in a pie. One has left its shelf. Place the correct one, or face the sky's wrath."

**The Setup:** 24 statue positions, one empty space, several candidate statues.

**The Solution:** Identify the correct blackbird based on "Sing a Song of Sixpence" nursery rhyme.

**Consequence for Wrong Answer:** Lightning damage (2d6-3d6, DC 13 DEX save for half).

### Consequences

- **Success:** The Lost Knight congratulates them and opens the passage to the Upside Down
- **Failure (Riddle 1):** Endless chasing until they realize the trick
- **Failure (Riddle 2):** Lightning damage, can try again with different statue

**The Warning:**
> "Know this - the way through is one direction only. You must find another path home."

## Environmental Effects

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Shifting Walls | Passages seem to move when not observed |
| Temperature Flux | Alternates between hot and cold unpredictably |
| Muffled Sound | Voices don't carry normally |
| Disorientation | DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) to track direction |

## Threats/Dangers

- Getting lost (random paths)
- The riddle challenges
- Lightning damage from wrong answers
- Time pressure (supplies, rest difficulty)

## Secrets

- The labyrinth was created to guard the passage to the Upside Down
- The Lost Knight has been here for ages, bound by duty
- The maze is semi-sentient, responding to travelers' intentions
- Success at the riddles stabilizes the labyrinth for the return journey

## The Passage to the Upside Down

After solving both riddles:

> "You have proven yourselves worthy. The passage to the Upside Down awaits."

The Lost Knight gestures, and a portal opens - swirling darkness with hints of corruption beyond. This is a one-way passage.

## Connections

- **Came from:** Troglodyte Caverns (Area 11)
- **Leads to:** The Upside Down (Chapter 5)

## DM Notes

**Purpose:**
The labyrinth serves as a transition zone between the traditional dungeon (caverns) and the otherworldly horror of the Upside Down. It provides:
- A change of pace from combat
- Classic puzzle/riddle challenge
- Building tension before the horror section

**Pacing Tips:**
- Don't let randomness drag - 2-3 rolls maximum before Lost Knight
- The riddles should feel fair but challenging
- If players are stuck, have the Knight repeat key phrases
- Total time: 20-30 minutes

**Atmosphere:**
- Describe the maze as unsettling and ever-shifting
- Build tension as they approach the Upside Down
- The Lost Knight is enigmatic, not hostile

**If Players Attack the Lost Knight:**
He fades away and reappears elsewhere, forcing them to find him again. Combat is not the solution.
