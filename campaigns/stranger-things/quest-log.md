- **The Lost Knight:** Guardian of riddles, key to Upside Down passage
- **Troglodyte Leaders:** Optional diplomacy targets
- **Road NPCs:** Information sources

### Multiple Solution Paths
The adventure emphasizes that:
- Combat is not the only solution
- Diplomacy with troglodytes is possible
- The Demogorgon can be wounded rather than killed
- Failure in one area rarely ends the adventure

**Additional Quest Notes:**
- Fire damage is ESSENTIAL against the Thessalhydra - without it, regeneration makes victory nearly impossible
- The Demogorgon doesn't need to be killed - wounding it enough allows escape to the final area
- Collecting all 8 Thessalhydra heads earns maximum reward (800 gp)
- The return journey is easier - the labyrinth stabilizes, caverns are quiet
- Sir Tristan provides a feast and hero's celebration upon victory
