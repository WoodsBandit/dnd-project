# Dragon of Icespire Peak

> *A young white dragon terrorizes the Sword Coast, and the small mining town of Phandalin needs heroes to answer the call.*

## Setting Summary

**Dragon of Icespire Peak** is the introductory adventure from the D&D Essentials Kit, designed for characters levels 1-6 (7 with final encounter). Set in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms, the adventure centers on the frontier mining town of **Phandalin** and the surrounding wilderness of the **Sword Mountains** and **Neverwinter Wood**.

The adventure takes place in the late 15th century DR (Dale Reckoning), contemporaneous with or slightly after the events of Lost Mine of Phandelver. Phandalin has recovered from the Redbrand threat and is now a growing frontier community--but faces a new menace from the skies.

### Geographic Context
- **Region:** Sword Coast North
- **Primary Settlement:** Phandalin
- **Key Wilderness Areas:** Sword Mountains, Neverwinter Wood, High Road corridor
- **Nearby Cities:** Neverwinter (northwest), Triboar (east)

## The Central Threat: Cryovain

**Cryovain** is a young white dragon who serves as the adventure's primary antagonist.

### Background
Driven from lands farther north by more powerful dragons, Cryovain descended upon the Sword Mountains and claimed the snow-capped range as his domain. He established his lair at **Icespire Hold**, a ruined stone fortress atop Icespire Peak--the tallest mountain in the Sword Mountains.

### Personality
Typical of white dragons, Cryovain is **dim-witted and cruel**. He lacks the cunning of chromatic dragons like reds or blues, operating primarily on instinct and hunger. He patrols the skies around Icespire Peak, hunting for prey and easy treasure.

### Impact on the Region
Cryovain's arrival triggered a cascade of problems:
1. **Displaced the orcs** from Icespire Hold, who fled into the lowlands and began raiding settlements
2. **Scattered other monsters** from the mountains, threatening Phandalin and surrounding areas
3. **Created a climate of fear** that has the townmaster hiding in his hall
4. **Threatened trade routes** and isolated homesteads

### Random Encounters
Cryovain can appear as a random encounter throughout the adventure, creating tension and foreshadowing the final confrontation. The dragon's stat block:

## Themes and Tone

- **Primary Theme:** Rising to meet a seemingly impossible threat through incremental preparation
- **Secondary Themes:** Community resilience, frontier survival, consequences of displacement (orcs, monsters)
- **Tone:** Heroic with sandbox freedom; starter-friendly but can turn deadly
- **Inspiration:** Classic D&D monster-hunting, job-board RPG structure

## Adventure Structure: The Job Board

Dragon of Icespire Peak uses a **sandbox structure** with a central job board mechanic.

### How It Works
1. The party arrives in Phandalin and visits the **Townmaster's Hall**
2. **Harbin Wester** (the cowardly townmaster) posts quests on a job board outside his hall
3. **Three quests** are available at a time
4. When all three are completed, three new quests appear
5. The adventure progresses through tiers until the party is strong enough to face Cryovain

### Quest Tiers

| Tier | Level | Quests Available |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Starting | 1-2 | Dwarven Excavation, Gnomengarde, Umbrage Hill |
| Follow-Up | 3 | Butterskull Ranch, Loggers' Camp, Mountain's Toe Gold Mine |
| Advanced | 4-5 | Axeholm, Dragon Barrow, Woodland Manse |
| Finale | 6+ | Icespire Hold (final confrontation) |

### Side Locations (Rumors/Non-Board)
These locations are discovered through rumors, NPC conversations, or quest connections:
- **Tower of Storms** (rumor at Stonehill Inn)
- **Shrine of Savras** (wererats from Mountain's Toe quest)
- **Circle of Thunder** (multiple quest connections)
- **Falcon's Hunting Lodge** (prerequisite for Woodland Manse)

## Major Factions

| Faction | Goals | Attitude Toward Party |
|---------|-------|----------------------|
| Phandalin Townsfolk | Survive the dragon threat | Friendly; need heroes desperately |
| Anchorites of Talos | Spread chaos via Gorthok the Thunder Boar | Hostile; worship evil storm god |
| Stone-Cold Reavers | Banditry and survival | Hostile; occupy Icespire Hold |
| Whiskered Gang (Wererats) | Reclaim Shrine of Savras | Potentially neutral if negotiated |
| Orcs (Displaced) | Find new territory after dragon displaced them | Hostile; raiding the lowlands |
| Gnomengarde Gnomes | Survive, invent, cure their mad king | Neutral/Friendly if helped |

## Starting Location

- **Name:** Phandalin
- **Description:** A small frontier mining town nestled in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Stone buildings with wooden roofs line dirt streets. The town is humble but growing, having recovered from earlier troubles with the Redbrand bandits.
- **Why the party is here:** Adventurers for hire, drawn by rumors of work and the growing monster threat. The townmaster is actively recruiting help via his job board.

## Connections to Other Adventures

### Lost Mine of Phandelver
Dragon of Icespire Peak shares the Phandalin setting with LMoP but presents the town in a **different state**--post-Redbrand, without active mine conflicts. Many of the same NPCs appear but in different roles. The adventures can be:
- Run separately
- Combined (with some modification)
- Run sequentially (DoIP after LMoP)

### Beyond the Dragon of Icespire Peak (Sequel Trilogy)
Three digital-only sequel adventures continue the story:

1. **Storm Lord's Wrath** (Levels 7-9)
   - Relocates to the town of **Leilon** (undergoing reconstruction)
   - Conflict between cult of Talos and local settlers
   - Features the priestess **Fheralai Stormsworn** as villain

2. **Sleeping Dragon's Wake** (Levels 9-11)
   - Continues the Leilon storyline
   - Can be run standalone or as middle chapter

3. **Divine Contention** (Levels 11-13)
   - Final chapter of the Beyond trilogy
   - Escalated divine conflict
   - Conclusion of the Talos cult storyline

These sequels were originally D&D Beyond exclusives but are now available on various VTT platforms.

## DM Guidance Notes

### Pacing Considerations
- The sandbox structure means players choose their path
- Some quests are easier than others at the same tier
- Cryovain random encounters build tension but can TPK unprepared parties

### Balance Warnings
- **Mountain's Toe Gold Mine**: Wererats require magic/silver weapons; allow negotiation
- **Shrine of Savras**: Ogres + orcs can be overwhelming; reduce numbers for small parties
- **Loggers' Camp**: Fixed enemy count with potential for surprise; deadly for 3rd level
- **Icespire Hold**: Cryovain is a serious threat; consider adding cold resistance potions earlier

### Recommended Additions
- Foreshadow Grannoc (anchorite leader) earlier in the adventure
- Give orcs at Shrine of Savras silvered weapons (explains how they displaced wererats)
- Add dwarf spirits or poltergeist lair actions to Axeholm banshee encounter
- Scatter potions of cold resistance or invulnerability before the finale
