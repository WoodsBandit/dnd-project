## Quest Details

### Quest Description
[FILL FROM BOOK - Exact job board text]

Summary: "Orcs have attacked Butterskull Ranch, five miles east of Conyberry along the Triboar Trail! Travel there with haste, assess the damage, and help any way you can. Ranch owner Alfonse 'Big Al' Kalazorn is a retired sheriff who can reward you for your efforts. If he's dead, return to Townmaster Harbin Wester with proof of Kalazorn's demise to receive a reward of 100 gp."

### Narrative Context
- The orcs were driven from Icespire Hold by Cryovain
- They've descended into the lowlands and are raiding
- This connects to the larger dragon threat storyline

## Rumors/Information

From the escaped ranch hand (in Phandalin):
- Orc attack happened about a tenday ago
- Barn and smithy were burned
- Big Al was captured
- Other hands were killed

From Big Al (if rescued):
- Details of the attack
- Information about orc numbers and behavior
- Concern for Petunia above all else

## Threats/Dangers

- **Orcs:** Main threat
  - Recommended: 3 orcs per character (not counting sidekicks)
  - Spread across the ranch to avoid overwhelming the party
  - Adjust numbers as needed

## DM Guidance

### Combat Balance
- Don't cluster all orcs together
- Let the party take on groups sequentially
- Each encounter can tell its own mini-story
- Feel free to adjust orc numbers mid-session

### Important Narrative Point
Make sure players understand WHY the orcs are here:
- They were routed by Cryovain
- They've taken to raiding out of desperation
- This connects to the larger story

## Quest Resolution

### Victory Conditions
1. Clear the orcs from the ranch
2. Find and rescue Big Al
3. Ideally save Petunia

### Rewards
- **Mithral Chain Mail** (rare armor) from Big Al
  - No Strength requirement
  - No disadvantage on Stealth checks
  - Appears as normal clothing
- Quest completion (100 gp from Harbin if Big Al had died)
