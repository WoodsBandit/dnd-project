[FILL FROM BOOK - Exact job board text]

Summary: Escort Don-Jon Raskin to Mountain's Toe Gold Mine. He's been hired by a Neverwinter consortium to take charge as the new overseer.

### The Problem
Unbeknownst to Don-Jon or his employers:
- The Whiskered Gang (wererats) has taken over
- They have no intention of leaving
- Normal weapons cannot harm them (need magic or silver)

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Combat
- Difficult without magic/silver weapons
- Wererats are resistant to normal damage
- Multiple wererats make this challenging

### Option 2: Negotiation
- Wererats aren't necessarily aggressive
- They will move IF the party clears their former lair
- This opens the **Shrine of Savras** side quest

### Option 3: Creative Solutions
- Multiple mine entrances allow different approaches
- Don-Jon's knowledge might help
- Other solutions players devise

## The Shrine of Savras Connection

If the party negotiates with the wererats:
- Wererats were originally at the Shrine of Savras
- Orcs (displaced by Cryovain) drove them out
- They offer to leave the mine if party clears the shrine
- This creates a new quest opportunity

## Threats/Dangers

- **Wererats (Whiskered Gang)**
  - Lycanthrope resistances (need magic/silver)
  - Evil but potentially reasonable
  - Will not budge from their position without deal
  - [FILL FROM BOOK - Wererat stat block reference]

## DM Guidance

### Party Preparation
- Characters may arrive unprepared for wererats
- Allow negotiation as an out
- Don-Jon might recognize signs of wererat presence
- Consider having silvered weapons available earlier in adventure

### The Negotiation
- Wererats are bullies but pragmatic
- They genuinely want their shrine back
- The deal creates interesting quest chaining

## Connections

- **Phandalin:** Quest origin; Don-Jon starts at Stonehill Inn
- **Shrine of Savras:** Wererat former lair; opens as side quest
- **Neverwinter:** Consortium that hired Don-Jon
- One of three Follow-Up Quests (Level 3)
