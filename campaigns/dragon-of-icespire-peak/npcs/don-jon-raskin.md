- Uses phrases like "Back when I..." or "That reminds me of the time..."

- **Disposition:** Friendly; sees party as capable colleagues
- **Owes/Owed:** Party escorts him to the mine

## What They Know

- Extensive knowledge of monsters (wererats, white dragons, etc.)
- Can recognize signs of creature presence
- General adventuring wisdom
- Tales and stories from across the Sword Coast
- Mining operations (claims more than he actually knows)

## What They Want

- To reach Mountain's Toe Gold Mine and take charge as overseer
- To overhaul the faltering gold mining operations
- To prove himself valuable to the Neverwinter business consortium
- To add this achievement to his list of accomplishments

## Quest: Mountain's Toe Gold Mine

### Background
- Don-Jon was hired by a Neverwinter business consortium to oversee Mountain's Toe
- He secured his reputation as a man who gets things done around Neverwinter
- He's never actually visited the mine before
- Claims (somewhat exaggerated) experience with gold mining

### The Problem
Unbeknownst to Don-Jon or his employers:
- The mine has been taken over by the **Whiskered Gang** (wererats)
- The wererats have no intention of leaving
- They're resistant to normal weapons (need magic or silver)

### Quest Options
1. **Fight the wererats** - Difficult without magic/silver weapons
2. **Negotiate** - Wererats will leave if party clears their former lair (Shrine of Savras)
3. **Alternative approaches** - Multiple mine entrances allow creative solutions

### Connection to Shrine of Savras
If the party negotiates with the wererats, this opens the **Shrine of Savras** side quest. The wererats were displaced from the shrine by orcs (who were in turn displaced by Cryovain from Icespire Hold).

## Adventure Hooks

- Can provide information about wererats and their weaknesses
- His stories might contain useful information about locations or creatures
- Could become a recurring NPC if the mine is successfully restored
- May appear in Stonehill Inn before the quest, telling tales

## Stats (if needed)

Use **Veteran** or **Scout** statblock (retired adventurer)
