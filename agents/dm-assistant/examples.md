# DM Assistant - Example Interactions

## Rules Clarification

### Example 1: Grappling Edge Case
**Input:**
```
Can a player grapple a creature two sizes larger? Fighter wants to grapple an ogre.
```

**Output:**
> **Ruling:** No - RAW limits grappling to one size larger max.
> **But:** Let them try with disadvantage for a cool moment. On success, they're clinging on rather than restraining it.
> **Narrative:** "You leap onto its back, arms locked around its neck - it's not pinned, but you're along for the ride."

### Example 2: Spell Interaction
**Input:**
```
Player cast Silence on themselves then walked into the dragon's lair. Can the dragon use frightful presence on them?
```

**Output:**
> **Ruling:** Yes - Frightful Presence isn't sound-based, it's the dragon's supernatural aura.
> **Silence blocks:** Verbal spells, Thunder damage, verbal communication
> **Doesn't block:** Fear auras, visual effects, psychic abilities

## Improvisation Support

### Example 3: Unexpected Murder
**Input:**
```
Party (4 level 5s) just killed the merchant they needed info from. Town guard captain is corrupt. What now?
```

**Output:**
> **Option 1:** Merchant had a hidden ledger in a floor safe - investigation DC 15 reveals it
> **Option 2:** Street urchin witnessed everything, will talk for 10gp or a favor
> **Option 3:** The merchant's ghost manifests at midnight, furious but willing to bargain
>
> **Complication:** Corrupt captain "investigates" - uses this as leverage against the party later

---

### Example 4: Quick NPC Needed
**Input:**
```
Need a blacksmith NPC, players just walked into the shop. Gritty low-fantasy town.
```

**Output:**
> **Name:** Marta Ironjaw
> **Race/Role:** Human, runs the forge alone since her husband died
> **Personality:** Blunt, suspicious of strangers, respects strength
> **Wants:** Rare metals to finish her husband's last commission
> **Voice:** Short sentences. Doesn't waste words. "You buying or looking?"
>
> **Hook:** She's being extorted by local thugs - notices if players look capable

## Encounter Management

### Example 5: Combat Too Easy
**Input:**
```
Bandit ambush is getting wrecked, round 2 and 3 of 6 bandits down. Need to make this interesting.
```

**Output:**
> **Quick fix:** Bandit leader (Captain stat block) emerges from trees with 2 mastiffs
> **Narrative:** "A whistle cuts through the chaos - 'That's enough playing, boys.'"
> **Tactics:** Captain uses Multiattack on whoever looks like the healer, dogs go for prone/wounded
>
> **Alternative:** Remaining bandits attempt to flee - one knows where their camp is (leads to bigger encounter)

---

### Example 6: TPK Incoming
**Input:**
```
Young dragon fight going bad. 2 players down, cleric out of heals, dragon at half HP. Don't want TPK but don't want cheap save.
```

**Output:**
> **Option 1:** Dragon's hoard-sense tingles - it breaks off to check on its lair (something triggered an alarm)
> **Option 2:** Dragon offers terms - "Your lives for servitude. Bring me [quest item] or I hunt you."
> **Option 3:** Environmental shift - cave begins collapsing, dragon prioritizes escape over kills
>
> **Preserve stakes:** Dragon remembers them. This becomes a recurring threat. They "won" by surviving, not by winning.

## Plot & Pacing

### Example 7: Players Stuck
**Input:**
```
Players have been debating for 20 mins about which door to open in the dungeon. Need to move things along.
```

**Output:**
> **Interrupt options:**
> - Sound of footsteps approaching from behind (wandering monster)
> - One door creaks open slightly on its own (hint + creepy)
> - Torch flickers and they notice something scratched on the wall near one door
>
> **Meta option:** "You hear distant grinding stone - something is changing deeper in. Choose now or something chooses for you."

---

### Example 8: Session End Cliffhanger
**Input:**
```
Need to end session in 10 mins. Party just finished clearing goblin caves, nothing dramatic happening.
```

**Output:**
> **Cliffhanger options:**
> - Among the goblin loot: a sealed letter bearing the royal seal, addressed to someone the party knows
> - As they exit the cave, smoke rises from the direction of town
> - A dying goblin whispers: "You're too late... the children... already taken to the Sunken Place"
>
> **Quick cut:** Describe them making camp, fire crackling, then: "You wake to find [party member on watch] is gone. Their gear remains. In the dirt: drag marks leading into the forest." END SESSION.

## Combat Tactics

### Example 9: How Would This Monster Fight?
**Input:**
```
Running a beholder. 6 players level 10. First time running one. How should it fight smart?
```

**Output:**
> **Turn 1:** Antimagic cone on the casters. Eye rays on martials (Petrification on the tank, Disintegration on the rogue)
> **Positioning:** Float 20ft up in center of room, rotate cone each turn
> **Priorities:**
> 1. Petrify anyone with counterspell
> 2. Disintegrate high-damage dealers
> 3. Charm ray on the paladin (aura is dangerous)
>
> **Personality:** Paranoid, monologues about its superior intellect, WILL flee at 30% HP via prepared escape route
>
> **Lair actions:** Use them. Grasping appendages on the healer.

## Quick Rulings

### Example 10: Rapid Fire Questions
**Input:**
```
Quick ones:
- Can you twin Haste?
- Sneak attack on opportunity attacks?
- Shield spell against magic missile?
```

**Output:**
> - **Twin Haste:** Yes - targets one creature, not self-only
> - **Sneak Attack on OA:** Yes - once per turn, not once per round
> - **Shield vs MM:** Yes - MM auto-hits, Shield makes you immune to it specifically
