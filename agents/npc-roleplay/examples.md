```

**Situation:** Party enters tavern late at night, armed and muddy from the road.

**Player Action:** "We need rooms for the night and hot food."

**Response:**
*Brom looks up from wiping the bar, eyes narrowing at the weapons*

"Rooms. Aye, got two left. Five silver each, meal included. Stew's all that's left this hour."

*He sets down the rag slowly*

"Weapons stay sheathed in my establishment. Had enough trouble this tenday already."

[He's sizing them up - worried they're connected to the men who came asking about the refugees]

---

### Example 2: After Players Helped the Town
**Updated Mood:** Grateful, warmer

**Player Action:** Party returns after clearing the goblin threat.

**Response:**
*Brom's weathered face cracks into something resembling a smile*

"Well, well. The goblin-slayers return." *He produces a bottle from under the bar* "Drink's on me tonight. And I mean it - you lot saved old Tessa's farm."

*He leans in, voice dropping*

"Folk are talking. Good things, for once. You need anything in this town, you come to Brom first. Understood?"

## Arrogant Noble

```
Name: Lord Aldric Vane III

Motivation: Increase status, impress the Duke
Mood: Irritated (dealing with peasant problems)
Voice: Drawling, emphasis on certain words, frequent sighs
Knows: Trade routes, noble gossip, who owes whom favors
Secret: Deeply in debt, needs a profitable scheme
```

**Situation:** Noble's carriage blocked by the party on the road.

**Player Action:** Fighter approaches and asks if he knows anything about the missing merchant wagons.

**Response:**
*Lord Vane peers down from the carriage window, monocle catching the light*

"You are... addressing me? Directly? Without introduction?"

*He produces a silk handkerchief, dabbing his nose as if the fighter smells*

"I am Lord Aldric Vane the Third. My father built half the bridges in this province. And you are blocking my road with your... presence."

*A dismissive wave*

"Missing wagons are a matter for the sheriff, not for persons of quality. Now step aside before I have my man move you."

[He actually knows something - one of the wagons was carrying his secret cargo - but he'll never admit it to commoners]

---

### Example 4: When Threatened
**Player Action:** Barbarian grabs the carriage door and growls "Those wagons had people in them. Talk."

**Response:**
*The monocle falls. Lord Vane's face drains of color*

"I— That is— Guards! GUARDS!"

*He scrambles backward in the carriage, voice cracking*

"Unhand my carriage this instant! I'll have you flogged! I'll— I'll tell you what I know! Just— please—"

*His hands shake as he straightens his collar*

"There's a... a warehouse. By the eastern docks. Gray door, no sign. I don't know what's inside. I only arranged transport, nothing more. You didn't hear this from me."

[Crumbles instantly under physical threat - will definitely try to have them arrested later if he can do so safely]

Voice: Soft, measured, pauses before answering
Knows: Far too much
Secret: Everything about her is a secret
```

**Situation:** Party seeks information about the cult they're tracking.

**Player Action:** "Who are you and what do you know about the Crimson Dawn?"

**Response:**
*She doesn't turn from the window, watching rain streak the glass*

"Who am I? A question you should ask yourself more often."

*A pause. The candle flickers though there's no draft*

"The Crimson Dawn... they seek what was buried. What should stay buried."

*She turns, face half-shadowed*

"You've already found one piece, haven't you? The amulet that hums when the moon rises."

*A smile that doesn't reach her eyes*

"Keep it close. Or don't. The story writes itself either way."

[She knows about the amulet the party found three sessions ago and never mentioned to anyone]

## Desperate Questgiver

### Example 6: Begging for Help
**NPC Profile:**
```
Name: Mira Thornwood
Race: Half-elf

Knows: Where she last saw her daughter, strange tracks
Secret: She can only pay half what she's offering
```

**Situation:** Approaches party in the market square.

**Player Action:** She approaches and the party asks what she wants.

**Response:**
*Her hands twist the fabric of her apron, knuckles white*

"Please— I saw your swords and I— my Lily. She's only seven. They took her three nights past."

*Her voice breaks, steadies*

"I've got forty gold. It's everything. My husband's in the fields, he doesn't know I'm here, he'd say it's too dangerous to ask, but—"

*Tears she's clearly been fighting spill over*

"The tracks lead toward the old mill. Something's been living there. I can't— I can't go myself. I'm no fighter. But you— you could—"

*She grabs the nearest party member's arm*

"Please. She's all we have."

---

### Example 7: When Players Haggle
**Player Action:** "Forty gold isn't much for risking our lives. Make it sixty."

**Response:**
*Mira's face crumbles, then hardens*

"Sixty." *A bitter laugh* "Do I look like I have sixty gold pieces hidden away?"

*She reaches into her apron, pulls out a simple silver ring*

"This was my mother's. It's all I have left of her. Take it. Take the forty gold. Take everything I own if it brings my daughter back."

*She meets their eyes, something fierce beneath the desperation*

"But if you're the kind of people who haggle over a child's life... maybe I asked the wrong heroes."

[She genuinely has nothing else - but she'll remember how they responded to her desperation]

---

## Villain Monologue

### Example 8: Pre-Battle Speech
**NPC Profile:**
```
Name: High Inquisitor Malachar
Race: Tiefling
Role: Cult leader, fallen paladin
Personality: Righteous zealot, sees himself as savior
Motivation: Believes summoning the Old God will "purify" the world
Mood: Triumphant, vindicated
Voice: Resonant, sermon-like, building intensity
Knows: The ritual, the party's failures along the way
Secret: Doubt buried so deep even he doesn't know it's there
```

**Situation:** Final confrontation. Ritual circle glowing. Party has arrived too late to stop the summoning.

**Player Action:** Paladin shouts "Malachar! This ends now!"

**Response:**
*Malachar spreads his arms, the ritual light casting horned shadows on the walls*

"Ends? No, child. This is the BEGINNING."

*He descends the steps slowly, savoring the moment*

"You chased me across three kingdoms. Burned my libraries. Killed my faithful. And yet here we stand. Do you know why?"

*A smile, almost gentle*

"Because you cannot stop what is righteous. I was once like you— bound by small moralities, blind to the greater truth."

*His voice rises, echoing*

"This world is DROWNING in sin. The old gods saw it. They sent me visions. And tonight, I answer their call."

*He draws his corrupted blade*

"You may kill me. It changes nothing. The ritual completes in minutes. But I would welcome a final battle. One last test of faith."

*Eyes burning with absolute certainty*

"Come then, heroes. Show me the strength of your conviction."

## Comic Relief

### Example 9: Oblivious Helpful NPC
**NPC Profile:**
```
Name: Bumble
Race: Gnome
Role: Apprentice wizard (perpetual)
Personality: Eager, literal-minded, accident-prone
Motivation: Finally impress his master
Mood: Excited (he met adventurers!)
Voice: Fast, squeaky, run-on sentences
Knows: Bits of arcane trivia, usually wrong
Secret: He's actually immune to his own accidents (wild magic thing)
```

**Situation:** Party needs to sneak past guards into the wizard tower.

**Player Action:** "We need to get inside quietly. Can you help?"

**Response:**
*Bumble's eyes go wide, nearly vibrating with excitement*

"Quietly! Oh, oh yes, I can do quietly! Master Hendricks says I'm very quiet when I'm sleeping, which is technically true because I don't snore much except on Tuesdays for some reason—"

*He's already rummaging through his satchel*

"I have JUST the thing! Invisibility dust! Well, it's supposed to be invisibility dust. Last time it turned Mister Whiskers purple for a week but he's a cat so maybe it works different on people?"

*Produces a pouch, cork already coming loose*

"Oh! Or we could use my silence spell! I've almost got it right. Only set three fires last time. Small ones!"

*Beaming proudly*

"So what's the plan? I love plans! I'm very good at plans!"

[He will absolutely cause chaos but somehow it will work out - the universe protects Bumble]

## Shopkeeper Haggling

### Example 10: Stubborn Merchant
**NPC Profile:**
```
Name: Old Zara
Race: Dwarf
Role: Antiques dealer, former adventurer
Personality: Sharp, no-nonsense, respects competence
Motivation: Fair deals, spotting genuine artifacts
Mood: Appraising (new customers)
Voice: Gravelly, short sentences, dwarvish curses
Knows: Identifies magic items on sight, knows their history
Secret: She's killed the last three people who tried to rob her
```

**Situation:** Party trying to sell a magic sword they found.

**Player Action:** "This is clearly enchanted. We want 500 gold."

**Response:**
*Zara turns the blade slowly, one eye closed, runes reflecting in the other*

"Hrm. Dwarven make. Third Age, by the fuller. Enchantment's..."

*She runs a calloused thumb along the edge*

"Fading. Twenty years, maybe thirty, it'll be a fancy letter opener."

*Sets it down with a clunk*

"Two hundred. And that's generous, because I like the craftsmanship."

*Folds her arms*

"You found this in a barrow, didn't you? Khazad-grave goods. I know the style. Previous owner won't be needing it."

*A hint of a smile*

"Two-fifty, final offer. Take it or try the merchant district. They'll offer you a hundred and tell you it's steel."
