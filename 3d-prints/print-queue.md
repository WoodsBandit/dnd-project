## Queue Management Tips

1. **Estimate conservatively** - Add 20% to slicer estimates
2. **Batch by material/color** - Reduce filament swaps
3. **Print terrain overnight** - Long prints while sleeping
4. **Minis during the day** - Monitor for failures
5. **Keep P1 realistic** - Only what you truly need
6. **Review weekly** - Reprioritize as sessions approach
