## GAMEPLAY INTEGRATION

### Terrain Effects

| Feature | Effect | DC/Rule |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Acid Pool | 2d6 acid damage on entry | DEX 15 to avoid prone |
| Bone Pile | Difficult terrain | Half movement |
| Crumbling Ledge | May collapse | DEX 12 or fall |
| Stalactite | Ceiling hazard | Attack or fall |
| Corroded Pillar | Half cover | +2 AC |

### Boss Tactics

**Round 1: Intimidation**
- Thessalhydra coiled on central platform
- Heads weaving, assessing threats
- Uses reach to strike first approachers

**Round 2+: Arena Control**
- Uses knockback toward acid pools
- Tail sweeps through bone piles
- Targets grouped players

**Lair Actions:**
1. Stalactite falls on random target
2. Acid pool bubbles, expanding briefly
3. Bone pile shifts, revealing emerging threat

### Encounter Balancing

The arena design supports various difficulty levels:

**Easier:**
- Fewer acid pools active
- More cover available
- Stalactites described but not falling

**Harder:**
- All hazards active
- Minions emerging from bone piles
- Acid pool expansion each round

## DESIGNER NOTES

### Why This Layout

The seven-area design creates a natural dungeon flow:
1. **Entrance** - Sets the tone immediately
2. **Outpost** - First combat/RP opportunity
3. **Acid Chamber** - Environmental hazard
4. **Feeding Chamber** - Horror atmosphere peak
5. **Inner Sanctum** - Sacred territory feel
6. **Treasury** - Reward before danger
7. **Boss Arena** - CLIMAX

Each area escalates tension toward the finale.

### The Boss Arena Philosophy

The 6"x6" central chamber is designed around these principles:
- **Tactical Complexity:** Multiple terrain features force decisions
- **Visual Drama:** Should photograph beautifully
- **Boss Showcase:** Thessalhydra mini is the star
- **Player Agency:** Multiple approach options
- **Danger Everywhere:** No safe spots

### On Acid as Theme Element

Acid damage is the Thessalhydra's signature. Every surface should show its presence. This creates:
- Environmental storytelling (monster has been here long)
- Consistent visual language (green = danger)
- Gameplay integration (pools, damage, difficult terrain)
- Horror atmosphere (dissolution, bones, victims)

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS

This terrain set represents approximately 40-60 hours of printing, 20-30 hours of painting, and countless hours of campaign building leading to this moment.

When the party enters that boss arena, when the cloth comes off and the lights dim, when the Thessalhydra rears its terrible heads - that's what it's all about.

Make it terrifying. Make it memorable. Make them earn it.

*The Thessalhydra awaits.*
