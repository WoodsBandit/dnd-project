# THE UPSIDE DOWN - 3D Terrain Design Specifications

## Overview
The Upside Down is a dark, corrupted mirror dimension - an oppressive nightmare realm where organic horror has consumed everything familiar. These terrain pieces capture the essence of biological wrongness: pulsing veins, fleshy surfaces, and an atmosphere thick with floating particles.

## TERRAIN PIECES

### 1. Organic Corridor Section
**Dimensions:** 2" x 4" (50mm x 100mm)
**Base Height:** 0.5" (12mm) | **Wall Height:** 2" (50mm)

#### Design Elements
- **Primary Walls:** Ribbed organic texture resembling exposed muscle tissue
- **Vein Networks:** Raised arterial patterns running vertically and branching horizontally
- **Pulsing Nodes:** Bulbous growths at vein intersections (3-5 per wall section)
- **Surface Corruption:** Irregular bumps and pustules across flat surfaces
- **Floor Integration:** Walls appear to grow from the floor, no clean edges

#### Sculpting Technique
1. Start with a basic rectangular wall form
2. Use the Clay Buildup brush to add organic mass irregularly
3. Apply DamStandard brush for deep vein channels (0.8-1.2mm wide)
4. Use Inflate brush on node points for pulsing bulges
5. Add micro-detail with Alpha stamps for skin/membrane texture
6. Ensure walls have slight inward lean (3-5 degrees) for oppressive feel

#### Print Settings (Resin)
- **Layer Height:** 0.03mm for maximum detail
- **Exposure:** Standard + 0.5s for crisp vein definition
- **Orientation:** 30-degree angle to preserve wall detail

#### Sculpting Approach
1. Model original ornate throne first (gothic/medieval style)
2. Create organic mass as separate layer
3. Boolean/blend where corruption meets original structure
4. Add transition zones: cracking, spreading tendrils
5. Include 1-2 areas where original gilding/detail clearly shows through
6. Optional: hollow throne back for LED backlighting

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### The Upside Down Aesthetic

#### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Dark blue-grey (#1a1f2e to #2d3446)
- **Secondary:** Deep charcoal (#0d1117)
- **Accent 1:** Arterial red (#8b0000 to #4a0000)
- **Accent 2:** Bioluminescent blue (#00334d, used sparingly)
- **Highlight:** Pale grey-blue for edges (#3d4f5f)

#### Texture Guidelines
- **Never Smooth:** Every surface has organic texture
- **Wet Appearance:** Surfaces should look damp, alive
- **Inconsistency:** Vary texture density across pieces
- **Layered Depth:** Multiple texture types overlapping

#### Form Language
- No straight lines in organic elements
- Curves should feel uncomfortable, wrong
- Weight at bottom, reaching upward
- Suggest slow, constant movement
- Blend manufactured elements into organic

## SCULPTING TECHNIQUES

### Essential Brushes (ZBrush/Blender)
1. **Clay Buildup:** Base organic mass
2. **DamStandard:** Vein channels, deep creases
3. **Inflate:** Bulges, nodes, pustules
4. **Move:** Large form adjustment
5. **Smooth:** Controlled blending only
6. **Standard:** Fine detail work
7. **Pinch:** Sharpening edges, tendril tips

### Recommended Alphas
- Skin/leather textures
- Organic membrane patterns
- Vein/arterial networks
- Cracked surfaces
- Noise patterns (multiple scales)

### Workflow Process
1. **Block Out:** Basic shapes, no detail
2. **Primary Forms:** Major organic masses
3. **Secondary Details:** Veins, nodes, major texture
4. **Tertiary Details:** Fine texture, micro-details
5. **Optimization:** Reduce polycount for printing
6. **Hollowing:** Where applicable, add drainage

## PAINTING GUIDE

### Required Paints

#### Base Colors
- Black primer
- Dark blue-grey (Vallejo Dark Sea Blue or similar)
- Charcoal grey

#### Layer Colors
- Medium grey-blue
- Deep red (arterial)
- Pale blue-grey (highlights)

#### Special Effects
- Gloss varnish (wet look)
- Fluorescent blue (bioluminescence)
- Blood effect paint
- Matte varnish (final seal)

### Painting Process

#### Step 1: Prime
- Black primer, full coverage
- Allow complete cure (24 hours ideal)

#### Step 2: Base Coat
- Heavy drybrush dark blue-grey
- Focus on raised surfaces
- Leave deep recesses black

#### Step 3: Vein Work
- Thin deep red paint (glaze consistency)
- Apply to vein channels
- Build up at nodes and intersections
- Blend edges into surrounding color

#### Step 4: Highlight
- Light drybrush pale grey-blue
- Only catch highest points
- Very light touch

#### Step 5: Effects

**Wet Look:**
- Gloss varnish on organic surfaces
- Avoid matte areas for contrast

**Bioluminescence:**
- Tiny dots of fluorescent blue in recesses
- Very sparingly used
- Focus on spore pods, portal edges

**Corruption Blend:**
- Where organic meets normal, use glazes
- Gradual transition over 3-4 layers
- Edge highlighting on transition

#### Step 6: Seal
- Matte varnish overall
- Gloss varnish on selected wet areas
- Allow full cure before handling

### Clear Piece Finishing
1. Do NOT prime - paint from inside if possible
2. Tint with transparent paints only
3. Polish exterior with micro-mesh (1500-12000 grit)
4. Apply gloss varnish for maximum clarity

## ASSEMBLY NOTES

### Modular Connection System
- All floor pieces: Flat 2mm edges for butting together
- Wall sections: 3mm tabs/slots for secure connection
- Optional: 5mm x 2mm magnets in bases

### Multi-Part Assembly
- Use plastic-safe CA glue (medium viscosity)
- Test fit all parts before gluing
- Consider pinning larger assemblies
- Fill seams with sculpting putty, texture to match

### Display Considerations
- All pieces should stand independently
- Consider weighted bases for tall elements
- Clear pieces benefit from dark backing for contrast
