# Ochre Jelly - 3D Miniature Design Specification

## Overview
An amorphous ooze creature for the Stranger Things D&D campaign, featuring the iconic split mechanic. This design includes a full-size jelly and two half-size versions for when the creature divides during combat. The acidic nature is represented through corroded base elements and translucent resin recommendations.

**Scale:** 32mm heroic scale
**Base Size:** 40mm round (full size), 25mm round (half size)
**Total Models:** 3 (1 full + 2 halves)
**Difficulty:** Beginner-Intermediate (organic shapes forgiving)

---

## Design Philosophy

The Ochre Jelly should appear both disgusting and dangerous - a mindless predator of pure hunger. Its amorphous nature means no two prints need look identical, and the organic blobby shapes are forgiving for printing. The split mechanic is a signature ability that deserves representation on the tabletop.

The Stranger Things aesthetic embraces the classic D&D ooze - a simple but effective monster that has menaced dungeon delvers for decades.

## Print Recommendations

### Resin Printing (Highly Recommended)

#### Standard Opaque Print
**Use When:** Painting the model traditionally

**Settings:**
- Layer height: 0.05mm (detail sufficient for organic shape)
- Standard exposure times
- Anti-aliasing enabled

**Orientation:**
- Print with base down
- No supports needed for most of body
- Light supports under prominent pseudopods only

**Resin Choice:**
- Grey or beige standard resin
- Easy to paint, good detail capture

#### Translucent Print (RECOMMENDED)
**Use When:** Maximum visual effect desired

**Resin Options:**

*Clear/Transparent:*
- Best for internal inclusion visibility
- Tint with alcohol inks for color
- Post-process polish for clarity

*Translucent Yellow/Orange:*
- Pre-colored, less post-processing
- Natural ochre appearance
- Internal details visible as shadows

*Translucent with Dye:*
- Mix clear resin with yellow/orange dye
- Custom color matching
- Best control over final appearance

**Translucent Print Settings:**
- Layer height: 0.03mm for smooth surface
- Exposure: +15% over standard (translucent needs more)
- Build plate exposure: Standard
- Careful support removal essential

**Post-Processing for Translucent:**
1. Careful support removal
2. IPA wash (fresh IPA for clarity)
3. Final cure in water (prevents yellowing)
4. Light sanding if needed (progressively finer grits)
5. Gloss varnish or resin coating for optical clarity

#### Internal Inclusion Printing (Advanced)

**Dual-Material Approach:**
1. Print inclusions separately in opaque grey/white
2. Suspend in hollow jelly form
3. Fill with UV resin (translucent)
4. Cure with inclusions embedded

**Single Print Approach:**
- Model inclusions as raised internal detail
- Print in translucent
- Paint inclusions after print (use thin paint inside)

### FDM Printing

**Feasibility:** Good (organic shapes hide layer lines)

**Material Recommendations:**
- PETG: Semi-translucent possible
- Translucent PLA: Available but limited
- Standard PLA: Painting required

**Settings:**
- Layer height: 0.15mm (lines add to texture)
- Nozzle: 0.4mm standard fine
- Walls: 3
- Infill: 15% (not visible)
- Speed: 45mm/s

**Orientation:**
- Base down, no supports typically needed
- Pseudopods may need support if extended far

**FDM Advantages:**
- Organic shape hides layer lines
- Layer texture can enhance "flowing" appearance
- Faster print time

## Translucent Printing Deep Dive

### Hollow Print for Translucency

**Why Hollow:**
- Allows light penetration
- Reduces resin usage
- Enables internal effects

**Wall Thickness:**
- Minimum: 2mm walls
- Recommended: 2.5-3mm for durability

**Drain Holes:**
- Two 3mm holes in base (hidden)
- Allows uncured resin to escape
- Essential for hollow translucent prints

### Resin Recommendations

| Resin Type | Brand Examples | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Water Clear | Siraya Tech Blu, Elegoo Clear | Highest clarity, requires tinting |
| Translucent Yellow | Anycubic Yellow, Monocure Yellow | Pre-tinted, may be too bright |
| Amber | Siraya Tech Tenacious Clear | Good base for ochre color |

### Tinting Process

**Materials:**
- Alcohol inks (Ranger, Piata)
- Colors: Yellow, orange, brown

**Process:**
1. Mix 3 parts yellow : 1 part orange : few drops brown
2. Test on scrap piece first
3. Apply to interior of hollow print
4. Build up thin layers
5. Finish with gloss coat

## Scaling Notes

### Current Scale Relationships
- Full Jelly: 100% (Large creature, 40mm)
- Half Jellies: ~65% volume (Medium creature, 25mm)

### Alternative Scalings

**Smaller Jellies (Gray Ooze equivalent):**
- Scale to 50%: 20mm base
- Quick minion-type ooze

**Larger Jellies (Black Pudding equivalent):**
- Scale to 150%: 60mm base (Huge)
- Boss-level encounter

## Notes for Sculptor

- Organic shapes extremely forgiving - embrace asymmetry
- Internal inclusions should be clearly recognizable but partially dissolved
- Split scars must match between halves for visual coherence
- Consider hollow version as primary for translucent printing
- Pseudopod drips can be fragile - test print thickness
- Base corrosion should be dramatic but not too deep (printability)
- Layer lines can enhance appearance - embrace for FDM
- Glossy finish is ESSENTIAL for final presentation
