# Giant Spiders - 3D Miniature Design Specification

## Overview
Large-sized giant spiders for the Stranger Things D&D campaign. These arachnid terrors feature menacing poses, venomous fangs, and optional web-spinning elements. Designed for dramatic tabletop encounters in dungeon environments.

**Scale:** 32mm heroic scale
**Base Size:** 40mm round (Large creature)
**Total Models:** 2 poses + web-spinning variant
**Difficulty:** Advanced (multi-leg complexity)

---

## Design Philosophy

Giant spiders should invoke primal fear while remaining faithful to classic D&D monster aesthetics. The design balances biological accuracy with fantasy exaggeration. These spiders appear as apex predators of the dungeon ecosystem - patient, deadly, and alien in their intelligence.

---

## Critical Print Considerations

### Leg Thickness Requirements
**MINIMUM LEG DIAMETER: 2mm throughout**

This is non-negotiable for structural integrity. Spider legs must:
- Maintain 2mm minimum at thinnest point (joints)
- Taper from 3.5mm at body connection to 2mm at tip
- Include subtle joint bulges (2.5mm) for added strength
- Feature slight curves rather than straight lines (strength + aesthetics)

### Leg Joint Strategy
Each leg has 7 segments. For printability:
- Coxa (body connection): 3.5mm diameter
- Trochanter: 3mm diameter
- Femur: 2.8mm diameter
- Patella: 2.5mm (joint bulge)
- Tibia: 2.3mm diameter
- Metatarsus: 2.2mm diameter
- Tarsus (foot): 2mm diameter with 2.5mm pad

## Print Recommendations

### Resin Printing (Highly Recommended)

**Why Resin is Preferred:**
- Maintains 2mm leg integrity
- Captures hair/bristle detail
- Fangs print cleanly
- Web elements possible

**Printer Settings:**
- Layer height: 0.03mm for detail
- Exposure: Standard + 10% for thin elements
- Anti-aliasing: Maximum

**Orientation:**
- **Pose A:** Print at 45-degree angle, tilted backward
  - Legs naturally supported
  - Fangs point up (no supports needed on detail)
  - Abdomen as lowest point

- **Pose B:** Print inverted (legs up)
  - Abdomen contacts build plate
  - All legs self-supporting upward
  - Remove with care

**Support Strategy - Pose A:**
- Light supports: Leg segment undersides
- Medium supports: Abdomen underside
- Heavy supports: None needed
- Avoid supports on: Eyes, fangs, hair detail

**Support Strategy - Pose B:**
- Light supports: Between legs only
- Build plate adhesion on abdomen
- Minimal supports overall

**Resin Recommendations:**
- Standard grey: Best for painting
- Black: Dramatic pre-colored option
- Clear/translucent: Web elements only
- ABS-like: Required for gaming durability

### FDM Printing

**Feasibility Assessment:** Challenging but possible

**Modified Design Requirements:**
- Increase all leg segments by 0.5mm
- Thicken fangs to 2.5mm
- Simplify hair texture to raised bumps only
- Web spinning variant not recommended

**Settings:**
- Layer height: 0.1mm (0.08mm preferred)
- Nozzle: 0.3mm required
- Walls: 4 minimum
- Infill: 20%
- Speed: 30mm/s for legs

**Orientation:**
- Print on side at 45 degrees
- Extensive supports required
- Legs printed separately recommended

**FDM-Specific Model Version:**
- Legs as 8 separate components
- Body in 2 parts (cephalothorax + abdomen)
- Pin/socket assembly: 2mm brass rod recommended
- Sacrifice some pose dynamics for printability

---

## Assembly Notes

### Integrated Print (Resin)
Single piece print recommended for:
- Pose accuracy
- Structural integrity
- Reduced assembly time

### Component Print Option
For painters who prefer subassembly painting:

**Components:**
1. Cephalothorax with fang assembly
2. Abdomen with spinnerets
3. Legs (4 pairs, pre-posed)
4. Base
5. Web elements (optional)

**Connection System:**
- Body parts: 4mm ball/socket joint
- Legs: 2.5mm peg into body socket
- Web to spinnerets: 1.5mm peg

## Notes for Sculptor

- Leg printability is the primary technical challenge - maintain minimums
- Test print single leg at proposed diameter before full model
- Consider print-in-place articulated leg option for advanced version
- Hair detail should enhance silhouette, not create support nightmares
- Web elements are supplementary - core spider must print without them
- Eye cluster arrangement critical for "alien intelligence" expression
- Venom droplets can be added post-print with UV resin if too delicate
