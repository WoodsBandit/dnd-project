# Troglodyte Warriors Pack - 3D Miniature Design Specification

## Overview
A complete pack of Troglodyte variants for the Stranger Things D&D campaign. These reptilian humanoids serve as common dungeon encounters, featuring primitive weapons and a distinctive stench that can be represented through vapor wisp elements on the bases.

**Scale:** 32mm heroic scale
**Base Size:** 25mm round
**Total Models:** 8 variants
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

## Design Philosophy

Troglodytes should appear primitive, savage, and distinctly reptilian. Their hunched posture and thick scales differentiate them from more intelligent reptilian races. The Stranger Things aesthetic calls for creatures that feel like classic D&D monsters filtered through 1980s fantasy art sensibilities.

## Print Recommendations

### Resin Printing (Recommended)

**Printer Settings:**
- Layer height: 0.03-0.05mm for scale detail
- Exposure: Standard for grey/beige resin
- Anti-aliasing: Enabled for smooth scales

**Orientation:**
- Warriors: 15-20 degree tilt backward
- Scouts: Crouching can print flat; climbing needs 45-degree support
- Shaman: Straight up with staff supported

**Support Strategy:**
- Light supports on weapon tips
- Medium supports under extended arms
- Island detection for vapor wisps
- Auto-supports generally sufficient

**Resin Recommendations:**
- Standard grey for ease of painting
- Beige/tan for pre-colored option
- ABS-like for durability (gaming use)

### FDM Printing

**Settings:**
- Layer height: 0.12mm maximum
- Nozzle: 0.3mm recommended (0.4mm acceptable)
- Walls: 3 minimum
- Infill: 15-20%

**Challenges:**
- Scale texture may lose definition
- Vapor wisps may require thickening to 2.5mm
- Spear shaft critical - print separately and attach

**Orientation:**
- Print all models flat on back
- Weapons printed separately recommended
- Vapor wisps as separate component

## Notes for Sculptor

- Ensure all models have consistent scale anatomy for cohesive pack appearance
- Thessalhydra symbols should be consistent across zealots and shaman
- Consider hero/commander variant of warrior for future expansion
- Vapor wisps are optional but enhance the "stench" monster ability visually
- Test print spear at various angles to verify 2.5mm shaft integrity
