## 4. Modeling Notes

### 4.1 Blender Workflow Recommendations

**Starting Point:**
1. Begin with basic dwarven mannequin (pose-able)
2. Block out major proportions before detail work
3. Use reference images for Dustin's expressions
4. Establish silhouette readability at actual print size

**Topology Guidelines:**
- Target: 100,000-200,000 triangles for final export
- Higher density in face and hands
- Lower density in hidden areas (inner arm, underside)
- Maintain quad topology for sculpting, triangulate on export
- Check for non-manifold geometry before export

### 4.2 Critical Structural Considerations

**The Lute - Printability Priority:**

The lute is the most challenging element for printing. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Solid Body:** The lute body MUST be solid (no internal cavity)
   - Hollow lutes will collapse or distort during printing
   - Sound hole is surface detail only (0.3mm depth maximum)

2. **Neck Reinforcement:**
   - Minimum neck thickness: 1.5mm throughout
   - Connection to body: Generous fillet (0.5mm radius minimum)
   - Consider slight thickening where hand grips neck

3. **Connection to Hands:**
   - Left hand should be fused to neck (no gap)
   - Right hand positioned over body with minimal gap
   - Small contact point between right fingers and lute face

4. **Alternative Construction:**
   - If fragility concerns persist, lute can be separate piece
   - Design locating pins (0.8mm diameter) for assembly
   - Include version with lute on back/slung for easier printing

### 4.3 Beard Sculpting Techniques

**Approach 1: Direct Sculpting**
1. Block out overall beard shape (solid mass)
2. Use crease brush to define major strand groups
3. Add braid detail with clay strips tool
4. Final pass with fine crease for strand texture
5. Maintain 0.3mm minimum between deep creases

**Approach 2: Hair Cards (For Resin):**
1. Create beard base shape
2. Model individual strand groups as separate meshes
3. Boolean union all elements
4. Cleanup intersection artifacts
5. Test print small section first

**Beard Tips:**
- Leave space between beard and chest (0.5mm minimum)
- Undercut deeply for dramatic shadow
- Braids should have clear separation from main beard
- Bead details: Simple spheres, 0.6mm diameter

### 4.4 Hand and Finger Considerations

**Left Hand (Chord Position):**
- Fingers curled around lute neck
- Index, middle, ring fingers visible from front
- Fingers fused to neck for structural integrity
- Suggest individual fingers with grooves, not gaps
- Hand thickness: 2mm minimum at any point

**Right Hand (Strumming):**
- Fingers spread dramatically (bardic flair)
- Thumb and fingers separated but with connecting membrane
- Membrane thickness: 0.4mm (will print as webbing)
- Alternative: Fingers in loose fist position (more printable)

### 4.5 Connection Points

**Model to Base:**
- Both feet flat on base (no pegs needed)
- Feet can be modeled as part of base for added stability
- If separate: 1mm diameter locating pins in heel and toe
- Consider scenic base with stone texture (dwarven heritage)

**Rapier Scabbard:**
- Fused to belt and leg (no separate piece)
- Contact point at mid-thigh adds structural support

## 5. Print Recommendations

### 5.1 Resin Printing (Recommended)

**Optimal Settings:**
| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.02-0.03mm | Fine detail preservation |
| Exposure Time | Per resin specs | Standard grey: 2-2.5s typical |
| Bottom Exposure | 25-35s | Ensure base adhesion |
| Lift Speed | 60-90mm/min | Reduce suction forces |
| Lift Height | 6-8mm | Clear supports properly |

**Orientation Strategy:**

**Primary Orientation: 35-40 Degree Backward Tilt**

Position the model tilting backward from vertical:
- Face angled toward build plate (protected from layer lines)
- Lute body facing upward (minimal supports on decorated face)
- Beard detail preserved on front-facing surfaces
- Rapier handle in shadow zone (support-friendly)

**Support Placement:**

*Heavy Supports (0.4mm tip):*
- Base bottom (build plate connection)
- Lowest point of cape/cloak (if any)
- Boot heels and toes
- Lute body bottom edge
- Elbow of strumming arm

*Medium Supports (0.3mm tip):*
- Beard underside (place carefully to preserve detail)
- Belt pouch bottoms
- Pauldron undersides
- Lute neck (opposite finger side)
- Rapier pommel

*Light Supports (0.2mm tip):*
- Hair curl undersides (where needed)
- Finger undersides (strumming hand)
- Belt buckle underside
- Small decorative elements

**Support-Free Zones:**
- Face (critical - orient to avoid)
- Front of lute body (decorative rosette)
- Front of beard (visible detail)
- Chest and armor front
- Hands (visible surfaces)

### 5.2 FDM Printing (If Necessary)

**Settings for 0.2mm Nozzle:**
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.08-0.1mm |
| Nozzle Temp | Per filament specs |
| Print Speed | 20-30mm/s |
| Retraction | Aggressive (minimize stringing) |

**FDM-Specific Modifications:**
- Thicken lute neck to 2mm
- Simplify beard braid detail
- Merge strumming fingers into paddle shape
- Add chamfer to all overhanging elements
- Consider splitting model (body, head, lute as separate prints)

### 5.3 Post-Processing

**Support Removal:**
1. Cure model for initial 2 minutes (structural integrity)
2. Remove supports while resin slightly pliable
3. Use flush cutters for main supports
4. Fine detail: Hobby knife and needle files
5. Full cure after support removal

**Cleanup Priority Areas:**
- Under beard (shadow area, be thorough)
- Lute sound hole
- Between fingers
- Belt buckle detail
- Boot fold areas

**Finishing:**
- Sand support nubs with 400+ grit
- Fill any print defects with cyanoacrylate + baking soda
- Prime with grey automotive primer
- Verify detail survival before painting

## 6. Heroic Proportion Adjustments

### 6.1 Why Heroic Proportions?

At 32mm scale, realistic proportions become difficult to read on the tabletop. Heroic scale exaggerates key features:

- **Hands:** 25-30% larger for weapon/equipment visibility
- **Head:** 15-20% larger for facial expression
- **Feet:** 15-20% larger for stability and visual grounding
- **Weapons:** 10-15% larger for silhouette clarity

### 6.2 Dwarven Heroic Adjustments

Standard heroic proportions are further modified for dwarven physiology:

**Exaggerated Features:**
| Feature | Standard Heroic | Dwarven Heroic | Rationale |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Head | 115% | 120% | Emphasize expressions, beard anchoring |
| Hands | 125% | 130% | Show instrument grip clearly |
| Feet | 115% | 125% | Emphasize grounded stability |
| Shoulders | 110% | 125% | Iconic dwarven breadth |
| Torso Depth | 100% | 115% | Barrel chest definition |

**Maintained/Reduced Features:**
| Feature | Adjustment | Rationale |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Leg Length | 90% of heroic human | Short, sturdy legs |
| Arm Length | 95% of heroic human | Slightly shorter reach |
| Neck Length | 80% of heroic human | Thick, powerful neck |
| Waist Width | 110% | No thin waist; solid core |

### 6.3 Equipment Scaling

**Lute Adjustments:**
- Standard lute would be proportionally huge for a dwarf
- Scale to 85% of human-sized lute
- Maintains playability appearance
- Looks appropriate for character size

**Rapier Adjustments:**
- Shorten to match arm length proportions
- Blade length: 10mm (vs 12-13mm for human)
- Guard size: Maintain for visibility
- Results in stockier, more dwarven weapon
