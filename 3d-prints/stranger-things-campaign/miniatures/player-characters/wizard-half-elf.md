## 4. Modeling Notes (Blender Workflow)

### 4.1 Project Setup

```
File Structure:
/wizard-half-elf/
  - wizard_base_mesh.blend
  - wizard_sculpt.blend
  - wizard_retopo.blend
  - wizard_final.blend
  - /references/
  - /exports/
```

#### Scene Settings
- **Unit System**: Metric, millimeters
- **Scale**: 0.001 (1 Blender unit = 1mm)
- **Viewport Clipping**: Start 0.1mm, End 1000mm

### 4.2 Base Mesh Construction

#### Recommended Approach
1. **Block-out Phase**
   - Use primitive shapes for major forms
   - Establish pose with simple armature
   - Verify proportions against reference plane
   - Create 32mm height reference cube

2. **Body Base Mesh**
   - Start with cylinder for torso
   - Add limb geometry with mirror modifier
   - Basic joint topology for pose adjustment
   - Target: 2,000-3,000 polygons

3. **Clothing Base**
   - Duplicate body mesh, scale outward
   - Use Cloth simulation for natural drape (optional)
   - Solidify modifier for fabric thickness
   - Boolean operations for layering

### 4.3 Sculpting Guidelines

#### Subdivision Levels
| Element | Subdivision Level | Approximate Polygons |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Face | 5-6 | 500K-1M |
| Hands | 4-5 | 200K-400K |
| Body/Robes | 4-5 | 1M-2M |
| Staff | 3-4 | 100K-200K |
| Base | 3 | 50K-100K |

#### Key Sculpting Brushes
- **Clay Strips**: Primary form building
- **Smooth**: Fabric surfaces
- **Crease**: Fabric folds, facial features
- **Dam Standard**: Sharp creases, wrinkles
- **Grab**: Major form adjustments
- **Pinch**: Edge refinement

#### Detail Priority
1. Face (highest detail density)
2. Hands and visible skin
3. Robe fabric folds
4. Equipment and accessories
5. Hair
6. Base elements

### 4.4 Minimum Thickness Requirements

Critical for successful resin printing:

| Element | Minimum Thickness | Recommended |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Staff shaft | 1.0mm | 1.2mm |
| Fingers | 0.8mm | 1.0mm |
| Fabric edges | 0.6mm | 0.8mm |
| Belt/straps | 0.8mm | 1.0mm |
| Ear points | 0.8mm | 1.0mm |
| Hair strands | 0.6mm | 0.8mm |
| Ring band | 0.4mm | 0.5mm |
| Base rim | 1.0mm | 1.5mm |

### 4.5 Hollowing Specifications

- **Recommended**: Solid print for this scale
- **If Hollowing**:
  - Wall thickness: 2mm minimum
  - Drain holes: 2mm diameter
  - Location: Bottom of base, two holes

### 4.6 Mesh Cleanup Checklist

Before export, verify:
- [ ] No non-manifold edges
- [ ] No inverted normals
- [ ] No internal faces
- [ ] No overlapping geometry
- [ ] Minimum thickness verified
- [ ] All elements watertight
- [ ] Single mesh or properly merged components

### 4.7 Separation Considerations

#### Recommended Separate Parts
1. **Main Body** (torso, legs, head, attached arms)
2. **Staff** (pin connection point at hand)
3. **Magical Effects** (if included)
4. **Base** (optional separation)

#### Connection Methods
- **Pin Holes**: 1mm diameter, 2mm deep
- **Key Locations**:
  - Right hand to staff
  - Effects to palm/base
- **Socket Joints**: For modular assembly

## 5. Print Recommendations

### 5.1 Resin Printer Settings

#### Recommended Printers
- Anycubic Photon series
- Elegoo Mars/Saturn series
- Phrozen Sonic series
- Prusa SL1

#### Resin Selection
| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Standard Grey | Prototyping, detail check |
| ABS-Like | Durability, gaming use |
| Water Washable | Convenience, slightly less detail |
| High Detail | Final production prints |

#### Layer Height
- **Recommended**: 0.03mm (30 microns)
- **Acceptable**: 0.05mm (50 microns)
- **Fine Detail Pass**: 0.02mm (20 microns)

#### Exposure Settings (Resin Dependent)
- **Bottom Layers**: 6-8 layers
- **Bottom Exposure**: 30-60 seconds
- **Normal Exposure**: 2-4 seconds
- **Lift Speed**: 60mm/min
- **Lift Height**: 6mm

### 5.2 Orientation Guidelines

#### Primary Orientation
- **Angle**: 30-45 degrees backward tilt
- **Face Direction**: Facing upward and away from build plate
- **Staff Alignment**: Parallel to build plate when possible
- **Rationale**: Minimizes supports on face, optimizes detail

#### Alternative Orientation
- **Angle**: 15 degrees forward lean
- **Use Case**: If back detail is priority
- **Trade-off**: More supports on face area

### 5.3 Support Placement Strategy

#### Support Settings
- **Contact Diameter**: 0.3-0.4mm
- **Contact Depth**: 0.2mm
- **Support Density**: Medium-High
- **Raft**: Yes, 2mm thick minimum

#### Critical Support Locations
1. **Staff** (full length support required)
2. **Extended right arm** (underside)
3. **Billowing robe edges**
4. **Left foot** (if raised)
5. **Hair overhangs**
6. **Belt accessories**

#### Support Avoidance Zones
- Face (especially eyes, nose, mouth)
- Visible front of hands
- Chest/front torso detail
- Ring of Protection detail
- Any surface facing camera in typical viewing angle

#### Island Detection
Run slicer island detection to identify:
- Floating robe fabric sections
- Separated magical effects
- Any disconnected geometry

### 5.4 Post-Processing

#### Cleaning
1. IPA bath: 2-3 minutes (two stage recommended)
2. Ultrasonic cleaner: 1-2 minutes (optional)
3. Soft brush for recesses
4. Compressed air for trapped resin

#### Curing
- UV exposure: 5-10 minutes total
- Rotate for even curing
- Water submersion cure: optional for clarity

#### Support Removal
1. Remove before full cure (semi-flexible state)
2. Use flush cutters at contact points
3. Clean up with hobby knife
4. Light sanding for witness marks (400+ grit)

#### Priming
- Zenithal prime recommended
- Grey or white primer
- Thin coats to preserve detail

|-----------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Head | 1/8 body height | 1/6 body height | 1.33x |
| Hands | 1/10 body height | 1/8 body height | 1.25x |
| Feet | 1/7 body height | 1/6 body height | 1.17x |
| Eyes | 1/8 head width | 1/6 head width | 1.33x |
| Sword/Staff grip | 4mm diameter | 5-6mm diameter | 1.35x |

### 7.2 Specific Adjustments for This Model

#### Head
- **Size Increase**: +25% from anatomical correct
- **Facial Features**: Slightly exaggerated relief
- **Eyes**: Larger, more deeply set for painting
- **Ears**: Full size maintained (character defining)

#### Hands
- **Palm Width**: +20% for visibility
- **Finger Length**: Maintained (elegant look)
- **Knuckle Definition**: Enhanced depth
- **Ring of Protection**: Oversized for visibility

#### Feet/Boots
- **Length**: +15% from scale accurate
- **Width**: +10% for stability
- **Detail Depth**: Enhanced creases

#### Equipment
- **Staff Diameter**: +30% minimum for printability

### 7.3 Silhouette Considerations

The heroic adjustments serve to:
1. **Improve Readability**: Clear class identification at gaming distance (arm's length)
2. **Enhance Paintability**: Sufficient surface area for color application
3. **Ensure Printability**: Meeting minimum thickness requirements
4. **Maintain Character**: Preserving the mysterious, powerful aesthetic
