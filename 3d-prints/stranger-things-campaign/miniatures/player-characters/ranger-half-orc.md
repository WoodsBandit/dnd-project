## 2. Pose Description

### Primary Pose: "The Tracker"

A vigilant, forward-leaning tracking stance that captures Lucas's practical, always-prepared nature. This pose was chosen over an active bow-draw for several reasons:
- Better structural integrity for printing
- Conveys the Hunter Conclave's tracking expertise
- Allows clear visibility of all equipment
- More dynamic than static standing without fragility issues

### Pose Specifications

**Body Position:**
- Slight forward lean (approximately 10-15 degrees from vertical)
- Weight distributed primarily on front (left) foot
- Knees slightly bent in ready stance
- Hips rotated approximately 20 degrees from forward-facing

**Left Arm (Bow Arm):**
- Longbow held vertically at side, slightly forward
- Grip at waist height
- Bow string facing outward (away from body)
- Elbow slightly bent, relaxed but ready

**Right Arm (Draw Arm):**
- Reaching back toward quiver
- Fingers touching arrow fletching (not fully grasping)
- Suggests imminent action without committing to fragile draw pose
- Elbow raised and back

**Head Position:**
- Turned 25-30 degrees to the right
- Chin slightly lowered
- Eyes focused on distant point (implied prey/enemy)
- Captures Lucas's skeptical, observant nature

**Legs:**
- Left leg forward, knee bent at approximately 30 degrees
- Right leg back, providing stable base
- Feet shoulder-width apart
- Creates triangular silhouette for visual interest

### Alternative Pose Option: "Ready Draw"

If a more action-oriented pose is preferred:
- Half-draw position with arrow nocked
- Bow arm extended forward at 45-degree angle
- **WARNING:** Requires separate bow printing (see Section 7)

## 4. Modeling Notes for Blender

### 4.1 Topology Guidelines

**Face Count Targets:**
- Full model: 80,000-120,000 triangles (print-ready)
- Subdivision-ready base: 15,000-20,000 quads
- Ensure clean quad topology for sculpting areas

**Key Topology Considerations:**
- Loop cuts around all joints for posability in base mesh
- Dense mesh on face for expression detail
- Scale mail can use array modifier, then converted
- Bow requires clean, even topology for smooth curves

### 4.2 Sculpting Priorities

**High Detail Areas:**
- Face (especially tusks, brow, expression)
- Hands and fingers
- Scale mail pattern
- Belt buckles and pouches
- Boot tops and bracers

**Medium Detail Areas:**
- Hair texture
- Quilted gambeson pattern
- Leather grain on equipment
- Bow grip wrapping

**Low Detail Areas:**
- Inner arms (often hidden)
- Back of legs
- Underside of scale mail skirt

### 4.3 Critical Thickness Checks

Before exporting, verify these minimum thicknesses:

| Element | Minimum Thickness | Check Method |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Bow limbs | 2.0mm | Measure tool, cross-section |
| Tusks | 1.5mm | Measure at base |
| Fingers | 1.2mm | Measure each digit |
| Arrow shafts | 1.5mm | Measure tool |
| Sword hilts | 2.0mm | Cross-section check |
| Ear tips | 1.5mm | Measure at point |
| Belt strap | 1.5mm | Measure width and depth |
| Ring | 0.8mm | Verify band thickness |

### 4.4 Boolean and Modifier Workflow

**Recommended Modifier Stack:**

1. **Mirror Modifier** (base mesh phase)
   - Use for symmetric base body
   - Apply before asymmetric equipment

2. **Subdivision Surface**
   - Level 1-2 for base modeling
   - Apply before sculpting
   - Level 2 for final smooth surfaces

3. **Array Modifier** (scale mail)
   - Create single scale, array in grid
   - Use curve modifier to conform to body
   - Convert to mesh, then shrinkwrap to torso

4. **Solidify Modifier**
   - Apply to thin elements (straps, belts)
   - Verify thickness meets minimums
   - Apply before boolean operations

5. **Boolean Modifier**
   - Use for sword scabbard insertion into belt
   - Quiver attachment to back
   - Clean up with manual retopology if needed

### 4.5 UV Considerations

While not required for printing, UV mapping aids:
- Material zone assignment
- Paint scheme planning
- Future texture baking if needed

Suggested UV islands:
- Body and head (primary)
- Scale mail (separate for detail work)
- Equipment (bow, swords, quiver)
- Base

### 4.6 Scale Reference Setup

**Blender Scene Setup:**
1. Set units to millimeters
2. Import 25mm diameter cylinder as base reference
3. Create 32mm height reference plane at eye level
4. Add 40mm maximum height marker
5. Use 1mm grid for detail work

**Reference Images:**
- Front orthographic
- Side orthographic
- 3/4 view for pose reference
- Close-up face reference (for orcish features)

---

## 5. Print Recommendations

### 5.1 Recommended Print Technology

**Primary Recommendation: Resin (MSLA/DLP)**
- Resolution: 0.05mm layer height or finer
- XY Resolution: 0.05mm (4K screen minimum)
- Suitable resins: Standard grey, ABS-like for durability

**Secondary Option: FDM**
- Only for larger scale prints (75mm+)
- 0.1mm layer height minimum
- 0.25mm nozzle recommended

### 5.2 Resin Print Orientation

**Recommended Orientation: 35-45 degrees backward lean**

```
Side View Orientation:

        ___
       /   \  <- Head (highest point)
      |     |
       \   /
        | |   <- Torso
       /   \
      |     |
     /       \
    /         \ <- Legs (angled down to build plate)
   /___________\
        |
    [Build Plate]
```

**Orientation Rationale:**
- Face oriented away from build plate (no supports on face)
- Bow runs parallel to build plate layers (maximum strength)
- Scale mail detail faces upward (minimal support marks)
- Base printed last (cleaner finish)

**Angle Specifications:**
- Backward tilt: 35-40 degrees from vertical
- Right rotation: 10-15 degrees (keeps bow clear of body)
- Elevation: Base approximately 5mm above build plate

### 5.3 Support Placement Strategy

**No Supports Needed:**
- Face and head (oriented up)
- Chest and front torso
- Top surfaces of arms
- Front of legs

**Light Supports Required:**
- Underside of extended arms
- Bottom of bow (if printing integrated)
- Underside of scale mail skirt
- Back of quiver

**Medium Supports Required:**
- Sword pommels and cross-guards
- Extended fingers
- Arrow fletching cluster
- Bottom of pouches

**Heavy Supports Required:**
- Bow tips (if printing integrated)
- Base rim overhang
- Any islands or floating geometry

### 5.4 Support Settings (Typical Resin)

| Parameter | Recommended Value |
|-----------|------------------|
| Support Density | 50-60% |
| Contact Point Diameter | 0.3mm |
| Contact Point Depth | 0.2mm |
| Support Tip Upper Diameter | 0.4mm |
| Support Pillar Diameter | 1.0mm |
| Z Lift Height | 0.1mm |
| Raft Thickness | 2.0mm |

### 5.5 Hollowing Recommendations

**Do NOT hollow this model**
- 32mm scale is too small for effective hollowing
- Risk of trapped resin
- Structural integrity concerns with thin walls
- Minimal resin savings

**If scaling up (75mm+):**
- Wall thickness: 2.5mm minimum
- Add 2-3 drain holes (1.5mm diameter)
- Place holes in hidden areas (under base, inner thigh)

### 5.6 Print Time Estimates

**Standard Resin (0.05mm layers):**
- Integrated model: 4-5 hours
- Separate bow: Add 1 hour
- Separate arrows: Add 30 minutes

**Speed Resin (0.03mm layers):**
- Reduce times by approximately 20%

## 6. Heroic Proportion Reference Guide

### 6.1 Proportion Comparison Table

| Body Part | Realistic Ratio | Heroic Scale Ratio | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Head to Body | 1:7.5 | 1:5.5 | Larger head for expression |
| Hand Length | 0.8 head | 1.0 head | Improved weapon grip |
| Foot Length | 1.0 head | 1.1 head | Better stability |
| Shoulder Width | 2 heads | 2.3 heads | More imposing silhouette |
| Weapon Shaft | Realistic | +25% thickness | Durability and visibility |
| Facial Features | Realistic | +30% | Readable at distance |

### 6.2 Visual Mass Distribution

**Upper Body:** 45% of visual mass
- Broad shoulders for Half-Orc strength
- Scale mail adds visual weight
- Quiver and bow add asymmetric interest

**Lower Body:** 35% of visual mass
- Stable, grounded stance
- Athletic but powerful legs
- Boots add visual anchor

**Equipment:** 20% of visual mass
- Bow is primary visual element
- Swords provide hip-level interest
- Pouches and details add character

### 6.3 Silhouette Test

The model should pass the "thumbnail test" - recognizable features at small size:
- Distinct bow shape on left side
- Quiver visible on back/right
- Two sword hilts at waist
- Orcish head profile (tusks, brow)
- Scale mail texture breaking body outline

---

## 7. Separate Bow Printing (Recommended)

### 7.1 Rationale for Separate Printing

**Structural Benefits:**
- Bow can be printed flat for maximum strength
- Layer lines run along bow length (strongest orientation)
- Eliminates difficult support placement
- Reduces print failure risk

**Quality Benefits:**
- Better surface finish on bow
- Cleaner grip detail
- Easier to paint as separate piece
- Can print multiple bows (backup/alternatives)

**Assembly Benefits:**
- More dynamic pose options post-print
- Easy repair if bow breaks
- Can try different bow angles

### 7.2 Bow Modifications for Separate Print

**Main Model Changes:**
- Model left hand as closed grip (cylinder shape)
- Leave 2.5mm diameter hole through grip
- Create flat contact surface on palm
- Add subtle locating ridge on palm

**Bow Changes:**
- Add 2.5mm diameter peg at grip center
- Peg length: 4mm (through hand plus 1mm)
- Flat bottom on grip to match palm surface
- Consider 0.1mm tolerance on peg for fit

### 7.3 Bow Print Orientation (Flat)

```
Top View:
    ________________________
   (                        )  <- Limb tip
    \______________________/
           ||||||||||         <- Grip (facing up)
    /----------------------\
   (________________________)  <- Limb tip

   [Build Plate - Flat surface]
```

**Orientation Details:**
- Lay bow flat on build plate
- Grip facing upward
- Belly of bow against plate
- Minimal supports on back of grip only

### 7.4 Arrow Cluster Separate Print

**Consider printing arrows separately:**
- Create cylinder plug (5mm diameter x 3mm tall)
- Arrows emerge from plug top
- Plug inserts into hollow quiver top
- Easier painting and less fragile during handling

**Arrow Cluster Orientation:**
- Print vertically (arrows pointing up)
- Plug at bottom on build plate
- Light supports on fletching undersides

---

## 8. Assembly and Post-Processing

### 8.1 Support Removal

**Tool Recommendations:**
- Flush cutters for main supports
- #11 X-Acto blade for detail areas
- Fine needle files for cleanup
- 400-800 grit sandpaper for smoothing

**Priority Order:**
1. Remove raft from base
2. Clear supports from quiver and back
3. Clean sword cross-guards carefully
4. Remove any supports from scale mail
5. Final cleanup of arm undersides

### 8.2 Assembly (If Printed Separately)

**Bow to Hand:**
1. Test fit peg in hand hole (dry fit)
2. Sand peg slightly if too tight
3. Apply small amount of CA glue (super glue)
4. Insert and hold for 30 seconds
5. Check angle and adjust before glue sets

**Arrows to Quiver:**
1. Ensure quiver opening is clear
2. Test fit arrow cluster plug
3. Apply CA glue to plug sides
4. Insert to desired depth
5. Adjust arrow angles if needed

### 8.3 Gap Filling and Cleanup

**If gaps appear at joins:**
- Use CA glue with accelerator
- Fine Milliput or Green Stuff for larger gaps
- Sand smooth after curing
- Prime to check for remaining imperfections

### 8.4 Priming Recommendations

**Primer Color Recommendations:**
- Zenithal prime for contrast guidance
- Black base for darker, moodier look
- Grey base for balanced painting
- Brown base for warm-toned scheme

**Primer Type:**
- Airbrush primer preferred for detail preservation
- Spray primer acceptable (light coats)
- Avoid brush-on primers (obscures detail)
