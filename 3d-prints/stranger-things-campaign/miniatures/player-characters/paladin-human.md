### 4.3 Hard-Surface Armor Techniques

#### Edge Flow Principles
- Maintain quad topology for armor plates
- Support loops around all hard edges
- Bevel width: 0.2-0.3mm for visible edge catches

#### Armor Plate Workflow
1. **Block Out**: Simple shapes matching silhouette
2. **Edge Definition**: Add support loops for sharp edges
3. **Surface Detail**: Boolean or sculpt panel lines
4. **Edge Polish**: Bevel modifier with 2-3 segments
5. **Trim Optimization**: Decimate while preserving edges

#### Recommended Modifiers Stack (per armor piece)
```
1. Mirror (if applicable, apply before posing)
2. Subdivision Surface (levels: viewport 1, render 2)
3. Bevel (width: 0.15mm, segments: 2, angle limit: 30°)
4. Weighted Normal (for clean shading)
```

#### Panel Line Creation
- **Method 1**: Inset + extrude (clean but polygon-heavy)
- **Method 2**: Boolean with plane (precise control)
- **Method 3**: Shrinkwrap detail mesh (best for organic armor)
- **Recommended Depth**: 0.15-0.2mm for visibility after print

### 4.4 Cloth and Cloak Modeling

#### Simulation Approach (Optional)
1. Create basic cloak mesh attached at shoulders
2. Apply Cloth simulation with:
   - Leather preset as base
   - Self-collision enabled
   - Pin vertex group at attachment points
3. Bake simulation with wind force
4. Apply and clean up mesh
5. Add fold detail with sculpting

#### Manual Approach (Recommended for Control)
1. Block primary silhouette shape
2. Define major fold lines with edge loops
3. Sculpt fold depth and secondary folds
4. Smooth transitions between folds
5. Ensure minimum thickness throughout

#### Edge Treatment
- Cloak edges: 0.4mm minimum thickness
- No paper-thin geometry
- Slight thickness variation for natural look

### 4.5 Minimum Thickness Guidelines

| Element | Minimum Thickness | Recommended |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Sword blade (flat) | 0.4mm | 0.5mm |
| Sword edge | 0.3mm | 0.4mm |
| Armor plates | 0.5mm | 0.6mm |
| Cloak fabric | 0.4mm | 0.5mm |
| Finger details | 0.5mm | 0.6mm |
| Chain links | 0.4mm | 0.5mm |
| Raised details | 0.2mm height | 0.3mm |
| Recessed details | 0.15mm depth | 0.2mm |

### 4.6 Undercut Considerations

#### Problem Areas to Address
- Under pauldrons (armpit region)
- Between legs
- Under cloak near body
- Behind stowed shield
- Grip areas around sword

#### Solutions
- Fill deep undercuts with support-friendly geometry
- Angle undercut surfaces >45 degrees where possible
- Consider print orientation in design
- Leave 1mm minimum gap for supports to access

### 4.7 Mesh Integrity Checklist

Before export, verify:
- [ ] All meshes are manifold (watertight)
- [ ] No inverted normals (recalculate if needed)
- [ ] No overlapping vertices (merge by distance: 0.001mm)
- [ ] No zero-area faces
- [ ] No internal geometry
- [ ] Boolean operations cleanly applied
- [ ] Mesh scale applied (Ctrl+A > Scale)
- [ ] Origin at base center

## 5. Print Recommendations

### 5.1 Resin Printing (Recommended)

#### Printer Requirements
- **Minimum XY Resolution**: 50 microns (0.05mm)
- **Recommended Resolution**: 35 microns or better
- **Layer Height**: 0.03-0.05mm
- **Build Volume**: Any (single miniature)

#### Optimal Resin Types
| Resin Type | Suitability | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Standard Grey | Good | Affordable, shows detail |
| ABS-Like | Excellent | Better durability |
| Water-Washable | Good | Easier cleanup |
| High-Detail | Excellent | Best for fine features |

### 5.2 Print Orientation

#### Recommended Angle
- **Primary Tilt**: 30-35 degrees backward (head higher than base)
- **Secondary Rotation**: 15 degrees clockwise (when viewed from above)
- **Rationale**:
  - Minimizes supports on face
  - Reduces layer lines on forward-facing armor
  - Allows sword blade to print at optimal angle

#### Orientation Priorities
1. Face and head detail (most critical)
2. Forward-facing armor surfaces
3. Sword blade quality
4. Cloak flow lines
5. Base detail (least critical, faces build plate)

### 5.3 Support Placement Strategy

#### Support-Free Zones (Mark as no-support)
- Face (entire front of head)
- Chest armor front
- Sword blade flat surfaces
- Shield front (if visible)
- Cloak outer surface

#### Heavy Support Zones
- Base bottom
- Back of legs
- Underside of pauldrons
- Cloak underside
- Pommel and guard underside

#### Medium Support Zones
- Back of cloak
- Rear of helmet/head
- Arm undersides

#### Support Settings
```
Support Type: Light or Medium
Contact Diameter: 0.25-0.3mm
Contact Depth: 0.2mm
Support Density: 50-70%
Tip Shape: Pointed (spherical for delicate areas)
Raft: Yes, 5mm diameter minimum
```

### 5.4 Separate Printing Options

For highest quality or easier painting, consider printing separately:

| Part | Benefits | Attachment Method |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Sword | Better blade detail | Pin to hands (0.5mm wire) |
| Shield | No hidden supports | Pin to back straps |
| Head | Face detail priority | Neck socket (1.5mm post) |
| Cloak | Reduce support scarring | Shoulder sockets |
| Base | Print flat | Foot pegs (1mm pins) |

### 5.5 FDM Printing Considerations

If FDM printing is required:
- **Minimum Nozzle**: 0.25mm
- **Layer Height**: 0.08-0.12mm
- **Print Larger**: Consider 150% scale
- **Simplify**: Reduce small details
- **Orientation**: Upright, face forward
- **Material**: PLA+ or PETG

### 5.6 Post-Processing

#### Resin Print Workflow
1. **Wash**: 2-stage IPA wash (dirty then clean)
2. **Cure**: 5-10 minutes UV cure (follow resin specs)
3. **Support Removal**: Flush cutters, then hobby knife
4. **Cleanup**: 400+ grit sanding on support marks
5. **Prime**: Grey or zenithal prime for detail check
6. **Repairs**: Fill any holes with liquid resin + spot cure

#### Common Issues and Solutions
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Layer lines on face | Sand with 600+ grit wet |
| Support scarring on cloak | Fill with Milliput/Green Stuff |
| Sword blade bent | Warm water reshape |
| Thin parts broken | Pin and superglue |

## 6. Special Focus: Winter's Dark Bite

### 6.1 Magical Sword Design Philosophy

"Winter's Dark Bite" is described as black metal that absorbs light. This creates a unique modeling and painting challenge.

#### Visual Concepts to Convey
- **Light Absorption**: Non-reflective surfaces, deep shadows
- **Cold Presence**: Frost accumulation, crystalline growth
- **Dark Magic**: Unnatural, slightly unsettling geometry
- **Ancient Power**: Worn but never dulled

### 6.2 Modeling the Magical Effects

#### Blade Surface Treatment
```
Primary Blade: Completely smooth mesh
Void Veins:
  - Organic, branching lines along blade
  - 0.2mm wide, 0.15mm deep
  - Originate from guard, extend 60% of blade
  - Pattern suggests frozen lightning or cracked ice
  - NOT symmetrical between sides
```

#### Frost Accumulation Zone
```
Location: 2-3mm band near guard on both sides
Appearance:
  - Crystalline buildup texture
  - Angular, faceted surfaces
  - Extends slightly beyond blade edge
  - Blends into smooth blade
Technique:
  - Sculpt with Clay Strips brush
  - Boolean with icosahedron fragments
  - Random scale variation
```

#### Guard Design
- Organic flowing lines (not geometric knight sword)
- Asymmetrical quillon shapes
- Surface texture matching frost zone
- Integration points where frost "grows" from guard

### 6.3 Painting Guide Notes

Include these notes for painting reference:
```
BASE: Vallejo Black (pure black primer)
TECHNIQUE: Wet-on-wet edge highlighting only
EDGE COLOR: Very dark blue-grey (not pure grey)
FROST: Pale blue-white, dry brush crystalline areas
VEINS: Slightly lighter black or very dark blue
POMMEL GEM: Deep purple with single white dot
NO METALLIC PAINTS: Matte finish throughout
```

### 6.4 Alternate Sword Versions

Consider modeling variants:
1. **Active Version**: Frost mist particles emanating (display piece)
2. **Dormant Version**: Clean blade, minimal frost (standard play)
3. **Sheathed Version**: For alternate pose options

## 7. Heroic Proportion Reference Guide

### 7.1 Standard vs. Heroic Comparison

| Body Part | Realistic 32mm | Heroic 32mm | Adjustment |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Head | 5.5mm | 6.5mm | +18% |
| Shoulders | 10mm | 13mm | +30% |
| Hands | 3mm | 3.5mm | +17% |
| Feet | 4mm | 4.5mm | +12% |
| Weapon size | 22mm | 28mm | +27% |
| Armor thickness | 0.4mm | 0.6mm | +50% |

### 7.2 Why Heroic Proportions

At tabletop viewing distance (arm's length):
- Oversized heads are recognizable as characters
- Exaggerated shoulders read as strength
- Larger hands can visibly grip weapons
- Thicker armor survives handling
- Bigger weapons identify class/role

### 7.3 Proportion Guidelines for This Model

```
Total head heights in figure: 5.5 (standard human is 7.5)
Shoulder width: 2 head widths
Hip width: 1.5 head widths
Arm length: 2.5 heads from shoulder to fingertip
Leg length: 2.75 heads from hip to sole
Torso: 1.5 heads from shoulder to hip
```
