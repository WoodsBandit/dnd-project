## 4. Modeling Notes for Blender

### 4.1 Workflow Recommendations

#### Phase 1: Base Mesh Block-out
1. Start with reference images on image planes
2. Block major forms with basic shapes
3. Establish correct proportions before detail
4. Use mirror modifier for symmetry (break later for pose)

#### Phase 2: Pose Establishment
1. Create basic armature for pose testing
2. Apply pose before detailed sculpting
3. Or use posed reference and sculpt directly in pose
4. Verify silhouette from multiple angles

#### Phase 3: Detail Sculpting
1. Work from largest to smallest details
2. Complete face before hair
3. Armor before accessories
4. Apply textures as displacement or sculpted detail

### 4.2 Minimum Thickness Guidelines

Critical for successful resin printing:

| Element | Minimum Thickness | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| **Ear tips** | 0.8mm | Consider thickening point |
| **Fingers** | 0.7mm | Avoid fully extended fingers |
| **Weapon shafts** | 1.0mm | Below may break during support removal |
| **Hair strands** | 0.6mm | Clump, don't separate |
| **Shield edge** | 0.8mm | Rim provides strength |
| **Chain mail detail** | 0.15mm depth | Surface texture only |
| **Cloak edges** | 0.6mm | Where not connected to body |
| **Ring band** | 0.4mm | Keep simple |
| **Floating elements** | 0.8mm minimum | Need support connection |

### 4.3 Chain Mail Modeling Techniques

#### Method 1: Alpha/Stamp Brush (Recommended)
1. Create seamless chain mail alpha texture (512x512)
2. Apply with drag stamp to curved surfaces
3. Use DynaMesh or Remesh to clean topology
4. Benefits: Fast, consistent, easy to adjust depth

#### Method 2: Displacement Map
1. Create high-res chain mail displacement map
2. Apply via Subdivision + Displacement modifier
3. Bake to texture for export
4. Benefits: Non-destructive, resolution independent

#### Method 3: Geometry Nodes (Advanced)
1. Create single mail "scale" or ring geometry
2. Instance across surface using geometry nodes
3. Convert to mesh for export
4. Benefits: Most authentic, but heavy geometry

#### Depth Recommendations
- Keep displacement/sculpt depth to 0.1-0.2mm
- Deeper creates visual noise at this scale
- Prioritize readability over realism

### 4.4 Handling Floating Hair Elements

**Challenge:** Hair wisps suggesting supernatural breeze

**Solutions:**

1. **Hidden Supports:**
   - Model thin connections to shoulder/cloak
   - Make connections 0.5mm or thinner
   - Place where shadows naturally fall
   - Can be carefully removed post-print

2. **Cloak Integration:**
   - Have floating hair touch cloak edge
   - Natural visual flow while providing structure
   - Easiest modeling solution

3. **Head Connection:**
   - Ensure all floating elements connect back to main hair mass
   - No truly isolated geometry
   - "Floating" is visual impression, not structural reality

### 4.5 Shield and Holy Symbol Considerations

#### Modeling the Emblem
1. Model emblem separately at 4x scale
2. Add all fine details at large scale
3. Decimate intelligently for miniature version
4. Apply as separate object positioned on shield face

#### Boolean vs. Direct Modeling
- Use Boolean for clean recessed elements
- Direct sculpt for raised organic elements
- Combine: Boolean base shape, sculpted refinement

### 4.6 Expression and Face Modeling

#### Key Proportions (Heroic 32mm)
- Eye width: 1.2mm
- Eye height: 0.8mm
- Space between eyes: 1.2mm (one eye width)
- Nose length: 2mm
- Mouth width: 2.5mm

#### Sculpting Priority
1. Overall face plane/angle
2. Eye socket and brow
3. Nose bridge and tip
4. Cheekbone definition
5. Lip line (most important mouth feature)
6. Minimal detail - let painting define

### 4.7 Quality Check Points

Before export, verify:
- [ ] No non-manifold geometry
- [ ] No inverted normals
- [ ] All elements connected (no floating geometry)
- [ ] Minimum thicknesses maintained
- [ ] Model is watertight
- [ ] Scale is correct (measure in mm)
- [ ] Polygon count appropriate for print (<2M recommended)

## 5. Print Recommendations

### 5.1 Recommended Print Technology

**Primary:** Resin (SLA/DLP/LCD)
- Layer height: 0.03-0.05mm
- Standard grey or skin-tone resin
- ABS-like resin recommended for durability

**Secondary:** FDM (for test prints only)
- 0.1mm layer height maximum
- 0.2mm nozzle preferred
- Will lose fine detail

### 5.2 Print Orientation

#### Recommended: 30-35 Degree Back Tilt

**Orientation Details:**
- Model tilted backward 30-35 degrees from vertical
- Face angled upward (supports will be on back of head/cloak)
- Shield arm as lowest point
- Casting arm toward top

**Benefits:**
- Minimizes supports on face
- Supports land on cloak back (hidden area)
- Good layer lines on visible surfaces
- Shield face prints cleanly

**Drawbacks:**
- Longer print time
- More resin/supports needed
- Must hollow for larger bases

#### Alternative: 45 Degree Side Tilt

- Tilt left side down (shield side)
- Shield back receives supports (hidden when displayed)
- Face remains relatively clean
- Use when back-tilt causes issues

### 5.3 Support Placement Strategy

#### Heavy Support Areas (0.4mm+ contact)
- Base bottom
- Underside of shield
- Bottom of cloak where it meets ground
- Mace head (if tilted down)

#### Medium Support Areas (0.3mm contact)
- Back of cloak floating sections
- Under raised arm (inner surface)
- Back of legs
- Under belt pouches

#### Light Support Areas (0.2mm contact)
- Back of head
- Ear backs (carefully)
- Hair undercuts

#### NO SUPPORTS - CRITICAL
- Face (front)
- Shield front face
- Hands (palm and fingers)
- Front of torso
- Holy symbol

### 5.4 Hollowing Recommendations

For 25mm base models:
- Wall thickness: 1.5-2mm
- Add drain holes: 2x 2mm diameter
- Place holes in base bottom
- Consider small hole in shield back

### 5.5 Post-Processing Guidelines

1. **Wash:** 2-3 minutes in IPA or Mean Green
2. **Dry:** Compressed air for recesses
3. **Cure:** 10-15 minutes under UV (turn halfway)
4. **Supports:** Remove carefully with flush cutters
5. **Cleanup:** Light sanding of support marks with 400+ grit
6. **Prime:** Zenithal priming recommended for detail preview
