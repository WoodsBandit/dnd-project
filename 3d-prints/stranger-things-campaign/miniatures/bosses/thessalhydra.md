## Design Philosophy
The Thessalhydra represents the climactic encounter of the Stranger Things campaign. This model must convey overwhelming dread and alien menace. Unlike a traditional hydra, the Thessalhydra's defining horror is the ring of serpent heads surrounding a central lamprey-like maw - a configuration that should appear fundamentally wrong and unsettling. Every design choice should emphasize that this creature is the ultimate test for the party.

---

# 2. POSE DESCRIPTION

## Primary Pose: "The Hungry Circle"

The Thessalhydra is depicted in a moment of aggressive anticipation - body coiled and tensed, heads splayed outward in a threatening display, central maw gaping open with acid dripping, tail raised with pincers spread wide.

### Body Position
- **Coil Configuration**: The serpentine body forms a loose S-curve with the main mass raised on a central coil, creating an elevated platform from which the heads emerge
- **Weight Distribution**: Front portion elevated approximately 40mm from base level, rear coil resting on base
- **Tension**: Muscles should appear flexed and ready to strike, with visible definition along the spine and flanks

### Head Arrangement
The 8 serpent heads radiate outward from the central maw in an asymmetric pattern suggesting independent consciousness and predatory focus:

| Head # | Position | Angle | Expression |
|--------|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Front-Left Upper | 45° up, 30° left | Mouth open, striking pose |
| 2 | Front-Right Upper | 60° up, 20° right | Hissing, forked tongue extended |
| 3 | Left Upper | 15° up, 70° left | Alert, scanning |
| 4 | Right Upper | 30° up, 75° right | Coiled back, ready to strike |
| 5 | Left Lower | 10° down, 50° left | Biting pose, jaws wide |
| 6 | Right Lower | Level, 60° right | Closed mouth, serpentine S-curve in neck |
| 7 | Rear-Left | 20° up, 120° left | Looking backward, defensive |
| 8 | Front Center-Right | 35° up, 10° right | Dominant pose, hood flared (if present) |

### Tail Position
- Raised high behind the body (apex at 70mm height)
- Curves gracefully upward then arcs forward
- Pincers spread wide in threatening display
- Creates visual balance with the forward-facing heads

# 4. MODELING NOTES

## Technical Sculpting Guidelines

### Multi-Head Complexity

**Head Junction Management**
The eight serpent heads emerging from the central maw area present significant sculpting challenges:

1. **Neck Origin Points**: Each neck must have a clear, anatomically plausible origin point around the central maw
   - Space necks evenly around maw circumference
   - Allow 4-5mm between neck bases minimum
   - Use organic membrane/flesh to blend connections
   - Avoid perfectly geometric spacing - slight irregularity adds realism

2. **Neck Intersections**: Several necks will cross or come close to each other
   - Heads 1 and 8 may have overlapping neck paths
   - Heads 3 and 4 necks run parallel, close together
   - Ensure 2mm minimum clearance between parallel necks
   - Where necks must touch, blend organically

3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Create clear visual flow despite complexity
   - Vary neck lengths significantly (22-35mm range)
   - Use different curve radii for each neck
   - Alternate tighter and looser S-curves
   - Ensure no two heads are at identical heights

### Minimum Thickness Requirements

For successful resin printing at 32mm scale:

| Feature | Minimum Thickness | Recommended |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Tongue tips | 0.6mm | 0.8mm |
| Fang tips | 0.5mm | 0.8mm |
| Neck narrowest point | 3mm | 4mm |
| Acid drip tips | 0.5mm | 0.6mm |
| Pincer tips | 0.8mm | 1mm |
| Scale ridges | 0.3mm height | 0.4mm height |
| Tail tip (at pincer junction) | 2mm | 3mm |
| Scenic base elements | 1mm | 1.5mm |

### Undercut Management

**Problematic Areas**
- Under the coiled body sections
- Between closely spaced heads
- Inside the central maw
- Under pincer edges
- Beneath raised tongue elements

**Solutions**
1. Ensure all undercuts have support-accessible angles (>45° from build plate)
2. Design hollow channels in body coils for drain holes
3. Consider splitting model at key points (see Section 5)
4. Orient acid drips to minimize support contact

### Hollowing Considerations

**Shell Thickness by Section**
| Area | Wall Thickness |
|------|----------------|
| Main body | 2.5mm |
| Individual heads | 1.5mm |
| Tail | 2mm |
| Base | 3mm (if hollow) |

**Internal Structure**
- Add internal support ribs in large hollow sections
- Leave solid: all heads, pincer tips, thin necks
- Create drain paths that exit at non-visible points

# 5. MULTI-PART ASSEMBLY OPTION

## Modular Design for Painting Accessibility

The Thessalhydra's complexity makes painting assembled a significant challenge. This multi-part breakdown allows for subassembly painting.

### Part Breakdown

**Part A: Main Body**
- Serpentine body complete
- All 8 neck stumps (terminating 5mm from body at consistent diameter)
- Central maw with teeth
- Connection points: 8 neck sockets (3mm diameter, 3mm deep)

**Part B: Tail Assembly**
- Complete tail from junction point
- Includes pincer assembly
- Connection: 6mm ball joint at body junction
- Alternative: keyed peg (4mm diameter)

**Parts C1-C8: Individual Heads**
- Each head with 25-30mm of neck
- Connection: 3mm peg at neck base
- Keyed to prevent rotation (flat side on peg)
- Each head numbered subtly on peg

### Connection Point Specifications

**Neck Connections (8x)**
```
Socket (on body): 3mm diameter, 3mm deep, keyed slot
Peg (on head): 3mm diameter, 4mm length, keyed flat
Tolerance: 0.1mm clearance for friction fit
Optional: Design for pin reinforcement (1mm brass rod)
```

**Tail Connection (1x)**
```
Ball joint: 6mm diameter on tail section
Socket: 6.2mm diameter on body
Allows 15° rotation for posing
Or: 4mm keyed peg for fixed position
```

### Assembly Order

1. Paint all parts separately on painting handles
2. Glue tail to body (optional pose adjustment)
3. Glue heads in order: 5, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8, 1, 2 (back to front)
4. Touch up any visible joint lines
5. Attach to base

### Pre-Assembled Version

For those preferring one-piece printing:
- All parts connected with 0.3mm bridging
- Bridges placed at inner neck surfaces (less visible)
- Can be carefully cut after printing if desired
- Increases print difficulty but maintains pose accuracy

# 6. PRINT RECOMMENDATIONS

## Printer Settings

### Resin (Recommended)

**General Settings**
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.03-0.05mm |
| Bottom Exposure | Per resin specification |
| Normal Exposure | Per resin specification |
| Lift Speed | 60mm/min (slow for fine detail) |
| Resin Type | Standard Grey or ABS-Like |

**Orientation Strategy**
- **Main Body**: Print at 30° angle, head cluster toward build plate
- **Individual Heads**: Print at 45° angle, snout down
- **Tail**: Print at 15° angle, pincers up

### FDM Alternative

For those without resin printers, FDM is possible with limitations:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.08-0.12mm |
| Nozzle Size | 0.3mm recommended (0.4mm acceptable) |
| Infill | 15-20% |
| Supports | Tree supports strongly recommended |
| Material | PLA+ or PETG |

**FDM Limitations**
- Fine teeth detail will be reduced
- Acid drips may require separate printing
- Scale texture less defined
- Consider printing at 150% scale for FDM

## Hollowing Protocol

### Main Body Hollow Specs
- Wall thickness: 2.5mm
- Infill: None (fully hollow)
- Drain holes: 3x 3mm diameter

### Drain Hole Placement
1. **Underside of main coil** (hidden when based): 3mm hole
2. **Inside of rear body curve**: 3mm hole, concealed by pose
3. **Tail base interior**: 2mm hole (if tail is separate, optional)

### Resin Drainage Path
Design internal channels to ensure complete drainage:
- Main cavity connects to all sections
- No isolated pockets
- Slight internal slopes toward drain holes

## Support Strategy

### Critical Support Areas
| Area | Support Type | Density |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Head undersides | Light | Medium (50%) |
| Extended tongues | Medium | Full |
| Acid drips | Light touchpoint | Minimal |
| Pincer undersides | Medium | Full |
| Body coil interiors | Light | Medium |
| Central maw | Light | Full |

### Support Settings
- Contact diameter: 0.35-0.4mm
- Penetration depth: 0.2mm
- Support angle threshold: 35°
- Raft: Yes, full coverage

### Support Removal Order
1. Remove raft from base
2. Start with large body supports
3. Work up each neck to head
4. Carefully remove maw supports (use flush cutters)
5. Acid drip supports last (gentlest touch)
6. Pincer supports

### Post-Processing

**Washing**
- IPA or water-washable solution: 3-minute agitated wash
- Second clean wash: 2 minutes
- Ensure all internal cavities are flushed

**Curing**
- UV cure: 10-15 minutes, rotating
- Ensure even exposure on all head angles
- Final cure: 5 minutes in water for surface quality

**Cleanup**
- Sand support nibs with 400+ grit
- Use hobby knife for tight areas
- Prime before assessing quality
