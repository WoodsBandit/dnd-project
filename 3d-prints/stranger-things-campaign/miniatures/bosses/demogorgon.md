## 1. Model Overview

### Physical Presence
- **Total Height**: 70-75mm from base top to highest point
- **Stance**: Hunched predatory posture, shoulders raised, head forward
- **Silhouette**: Unmistakably inhuman - elongated limbs, emaciated torso, nightmarish proportions
- **Visual Weight**: Imposing without being bulky; this is a lean, fast predator

### Design Philosophy
The Demogorgon is not a brute - it is a hunter. Every element of this miniature should communicate patient menace and explosive violence held in check. The closed-head variant whispers dread; the open-head variant screams it.

The signature flower-petal head is THE defining feature. It must dominate visual attention and be sculpted with obsessive detail.

## 2. Pose Options

### OPTION A: The Stalker (Head Closed)

**Concept**: The creature moves through darkness, hunting by scent alone. Head closed into its signature featureless bulb, arms slightly spread, weight forward.

**Pose Details**:
- Head angled downward approximately 15 degrees, as if tracking scent
- Right arm extended forward and low, fingers spread, claws nearly touching ground
- Left arm pulled back at shoulder height, coiled for a strike
- Torso hunched deeply, spine curved in an unnatural arc
- Right leg forward in mid-stride, toes gripping the base
- Left leg trailing, heel raised, muscles taut

**Emotional Read**: Creeping dread. The viewer knows what that head contains. The anticipation is the horror.

**Difficulty Level**: Moderate - fewer overhangs, stable stance

---

### OPTION B: The Reveal (Head OPEN - Attack Pose)

**Concept**: The iconic moment. The petals have split apart, revealing the hellish maw within. This is the creature in full predatory display.

**Pose Details**:
- Head thrown back, petals fully extended in a corona of horror
- Mouth interior visible, rows of teeth catching light
- Both arms raised and wide, claws fully extended, reaching toward prey
- Torso more upright, chest thrust forward in aggressive posture
- Stance wide and planted, weight centered for a lunge
- One foot can be raised on base debris for dynamic energy

**Emotional Read**: Pure visceral terror. This is the money shot. The miniature players will remember.

**Difficulty Level**: Advanced - delicate petal edges, multiple overhangs, requires supports

## 3. Detailed Feature Breakdown

### 3.1 The Flower-Petal Head (PRIMARY FOCUS)

This is the creature's identity. Allocate maximum sculpting attention here.

#### Closed Configuration (Option A)
- **Shape**: Elongated ovoid bulb, roughly egg-shaped but organic
- **Petal Count**: 5 distinct segments
- **Seam Lines**: Visible division lines between petals, slightly recessed
- **Surface**: Subtle organic texture, thin membranous appearance at edges
- **Tip**: Petals meet at a point, slightly offset (not perfectly aligned)
- **No Features**: Absolutely no eyes, nose, or recognizable facial elements

#### Open Configuration (Option B)
- **Petal Spread**: Each petal curves outward in a radial pattern, approximately 60-70 degrees from vertical
- **Petal Shape**: Elongated triangular, wider at base, tapering to points
- **Petal Interior**: Smooth, moist-looking membrane with subtle vein texturing
- **Petal Exterior**: Matches body skin texture
- **Petal Edges**: Thin, almost sharp - this is critical for the silhouette
- **Petal Tips**: Slightly curled outward, organic variation between each

#### The Maw (Open Configuration Only)
- **Structure**: Circular opening at head center where petals connect
- **Depth**: Recessed approximately 5-6mm to create shadow
- **Teeth Arrangement**:
  - Outer ring: Larger teeth, conical, angled inward (12-14 teeth)
  - Inner ring: Smaller teeth, densely packed (20+ teeth)
  - Teeth are not uniform - vary size and angle slightly
- **Throat**: Dark void behind teeth, suggest depth
- **Texture**: Wet, organic membrane between tooth rows

### 3.2 The Body

#### Torso
- **Build**: Emaciated, ribs visible through skin
- **Posture**: Permanent hunch, shoulders higher than head center
- **Spine**: Pronounced vertebrae visible along back, exaggerated curve
- **Chest**: Shallow, sternum visible
- **Abdomen**: Concave, stretched skin texture

#### Arms
- **Length**: Unnaturally long, fingertips reach below knee when standing
- **Proportions**: Upper arm and forearm roughly equal, both elongated
- **Joints**: Elbows slightly hyperextended, alien anatomy
- **Muscle Definition**: Sinewy, tendons visible, no bulk
- **Hands**:
  - 5 fingers, elongated
  - Each finger 50% longer than human proportions
  - Claws: Curved, 4-5mm long at this scale, wickedly sharp

#### Legs
- **Structure**: Digitigrade stance (walks on toes like a predatory animal)
- **Thighs**: Powerful, primary muscle mass of the body
- **Lower Legs**: Lean, elongated
- **Feet**:
  - 4 toes forward, splayed for grip
  - 1 dewclaw rear
  - Claws shorter than fingers but thicker

### 3.3 Skin Texture

**Do not make the skin smooth.** The Demogorgon's hide is a key atmospheric element.

- **Primary Texture**: Fine wrinkled leather, elephant-like
- **Color Indication**: Pale grayish (painting reference - not sculpted)
- **Variation Zones**:
  - Torso: Larger scale texture, stretched over ribs
  - Limbs: Finer texture, tighter
  - Joints: Bunched, folded skin at elbows, knees
  - Head petals: Smoothest areas, but still organic membrane texture
- **Special Details**:
  - Visible veins on forearms and petal interiors (raised lines)
  - Scarring texture scattered across back and shoulders
  - Subtle pockmarks/pores across body

## 4. Modeling Notes

### Critical Priority: The Head Mechanism

The open flower-head is the single most important element. Approach it as follows:

1. **Silhouette First**: Block out the petal spread to nail the iconic shape before adding detail
2. **Negative Space**: The gaps between petals are as important as the petals themselves
3. **Interior Drama**: The maw must read clearly even from tabletop distance - exaggerate depth
4. **Edge Definition**: Petal edges must be crisp and thin - this sells the organic horror
5. **Symmetry Breaking**: Subtle asymmetry in petal positions adds organic realism

### Proportional Guidelines (at 32mm scale)

| Body Part | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Total height (Option A) | 70mm |
| Total height (Option B) | 75mm (petals add height) |
| Head width (closed) | 12mm |
| Head width (open, petal tip to tip) | 28-30mm |
| Torso length | 25mm |
| Arm length (shoulder to claw tip) | 40mm |
| Leg length (hip to toe) | 35mm |
| Claw length (fingers) | 4-5mm |
| Base diameter | 50mm |

### Structural Considerations

- **Center of Gravity**: Keep weight centered over base for stability
- **Connection Points**: Ankle joints need adequate thickness (3mm minimum)
- **Arm Positions**: Avoid extreme overhangs; design for printability without sacrificing drama
- **Head Weight**: Open configuration is top-heavy; consider slight backward lean

## 5. Print Recommendations

### Printer Settings (Resin)

| Setting | Recommended Value |
|---------|-------------------|
| Layer Height | 0.03-0.05mm |
| Exposure Time | Per resin specs |
| Lift Speed | Slow (reduces suction on thin petals) |
| Anti-Aliasing | Enabled |

### Support Strategy

#### Option A (Closed Head)
- Standard auto-supports with medium density
- Manual supports under forward arm
- Light supports under chin area
- Hollow body acceptable (2mm walls)

#### Option B (Open Head) - REQUIRES CARE
- **Petal Edges**: Individual light supports on each petal tip
- **Petal Undersides**: Medium supports along interior curves
- **Maw Interior**: Support teeth carefully, remove with precision
- **Orientation**: Print at 15-20 degree backward tilt
- **Island Detection**: Check each layer for floating sections

### Critical Print Warnings

1. **Petal Edges**: These are the thinnest elements (0.5-0.8mm recommended minimum). Print slowly, cure thoroughly
2. **Teeth**: Extremely fragile at this scale. Consider slightly thickening for durability
3. **Claws**: Support each claw tip individually
4. **Hollowing**: If hollowing, add drain holes in feet (hidden by base)

### Post-Processing

- Careful support removal with flush cutters
- Light sanding of support marks on visible areas
- UV cure thoroughly before handling
- Prime with grey or zenithal for painting

## 6. Upside Down Themed Base

### Concept
The base represents a fragment of the Upside Down bleeding into reality - organic corruption spreading from beneath the creature's feet.

### Base Elements

#### Primary Surface
- **Corrupted Ground**: Cracked earth or floor with organic growth pushing through
- **Texture**: Mix of hard surfaces (broken concrete, cracked stone) being consumed by soft organic matter

#### Organic Corruption
- **Tendrils**: 3-5 vine-like growths spreading from center
- **Membrane**: Stretched organic webbing between some tendrils
- **Pustules**: Small bulbous growths scattered across base
- **Texture**: Wet, fleshy appearance

#### Floating Particles
- **Ash/Spores**: 4-6 small particles suspended on thin supports (0.5mm wire or printed stems)
- **Heights**: Vary from 5-20mm above base surface
- **Shapes**: Irregular organic fragments, not spheres
- **Positioning**: Concentrated near creature, dispersing outward

#### Environmental Debris
- **Options**:
  - Cracked floor tiles (residential setting)
  - Forest floor with corrupted leaves
  - Scattered small bones
  - Torn fabric fragments

### Base Construction Notes

- **Particle Stems**: Can be printed as part of base or added post-print (brass rod)
- **Terrain Height**: Keep under 8mm to not dwarf the miniature
- **Edge Treatment**: Organic tendrils can creep over base edge for dynamic effect
- **Underside**: Flat for stability, include model name and date

## 7. Painting Reference Notes

### Suggested Color Palette

| Area | Color Notes |
|------|-------------|
| Body | Pale grey-purple, almost corpse-like |
| Skin recesses | Dark purple-black washes |
| Petal interiors | Pinkish-red, wet look |
| Maw | Deep red to black gradient |
| Teeth | Off-white to yellow, not pure white |
| Claws | Dark grey to black |
| Base organics | Sickly greens and purples |
| Floating particles | Grey-white with slight glow effect |

### Key Painting Focuses

1. The maw interior should look wet and alive
2. Petal edges benefit from subtle edge highlighting
3. Skin texture catches drybrush beautifully
4. Eyes-less head is unsettling - don't add any eye effects

---

## 8. Variant Considerations

### Future Expansions

- **Damaged Variant**: Wounds from previous encounters (this boss can be hurt and escaped)
- **Emerging Variant**: Bursting through a portal/gate
- **Juvenile**: Smaller version for multiple encounters

### Modular Options

- Magnetized head swap (closed/open)
- Alternate arm poses
- Separate particle pieces for easier printing
