## Cost Considerations

### Material Costs (Approximate)

**FDM Filament:**
- PLA: $15-25/kg
- PLA+: $20-30/kg
- Typical mini: $0.10-0.30

**Resin:**
- Standard: $25-40/L
- ABS-Like: $30-50/L
- Typical mini: $0.20-0.50

### Cost Per Mini Comparison

| Method | Cost/Mini | Quality | Speed |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| FDM 0.08mm | $0.15-0.30 | Good | Slow |
| FDM 0.12mm | $0.10-0.25 | Acceptable | Medium |
| Resin 0.05mm | $0.20-0.50 | Excellent | Medium |
| Pre-painted (Wizkids) | $3-8 | Varies | Instant |
| Metal minis | $10-40+ | Excellent | Instant |

### Break-Even Analysis

Printer cost / (commercial mini price - print cost) = minis needed

Example: $200 resin printer
- Commercial minis: ~$5 each
- Print cost: ~$0.35 each
- Break-even: ~43 minis

Most D&D players print far more than break-even!

## Legal Considerations

### Personal Use

- STLs bought for personal use = print freely for yourself
- Gifting printed minis to friends = generally acceptable
- Check individual creator licenses

### Selling Prints

- Most STLs prohibit commercial use
- Merchant licenses available from some creators
- Always verify license before selling
- Patreon/subscription tiers may include commercial rights

### Copyright

- Don't print copyrighted characters without license
- Fan art miniatures exist in grey area
- Official licensed content exists (WizKids has some)
- Original designs are safest
